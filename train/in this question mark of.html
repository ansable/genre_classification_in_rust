    <p>Summary</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>the dreamies are the top art students of the school, and they're not ok</p><p>(or, a group chat where they all just roast mark, fall in love, and fall out of it at the same time.)</p></blockquote>

    <p>Notes</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>ok this fic is very self indulgent, and im only gonna start updating it regularly if it gets more positive attention than my other chaptered fic, long nights daydreams/sugar and smoke rings. otherwise, i probably wont update this as often. but! i actually love group chat fics and kinda want to make one of my own? hopefully this turns out well!</p></blockquote>

<p>lele: what?</p>
<p>cutiepie: im lost</p>
<p>sweetheart: oh shit is this what i think it is </p>
<p>sweetheart: jisung im sure its not like that </p>
<p>sungie: everyone says that but how would you know? im supposed to be his best friend right, i should know his fucking intentions</p>
<p>sunny: hey jisung maybe take this off a gc?</p>
<p>suffering: park jisung. dont start unnecessary drama.</p>
<p>sungie: all of you shut the fuck up</p>
<p>sungie: he deserves to hear this loud and clear, in front of everyone else</p>
<p>lele: i dont know what you’re talking about park jisung. </p>
<p>sungie: zhong chenle, ive been your best friend since we were three years old. you dont become best friends for that long without useless fights. over juice boxes and soccer teams, we’ve fought over many things. i remember one time, when we were seven, you stole my bubble wand. then we fought and made up. i remember in sixth grade we screamed at eachother in front of the wholeass school, and then we got over ourselves and made up. i remember in eighth grade, we both felt a little neglected and went to mark hyung to talk about it, as a group. we have never, ever, in all our history of being friends, lied to eachother. went to someone else for advice before the other. why did you change all of that? you started shading me on social media, and that’s fucking low. you almost broke our snapchat streak. you set. our fucking. chat names. to default. and now? you have an awful date and you dont tell me about it as soon as you get home. you act bitchy for absolutely no reason. i want you to tell me, right here, and right now, what the fuck is your problem with me, zhong chenle. </p>
<p>lele: you want to know my problem with you, park jisung? i admit, i told china line about junhyung asking me out before you. why would i go to you for advice when you have the same amount of dating experience as a fucking rock. i only started acting a little petty when you told your friends to be assholes to me, i see you, mark. im not bitchy for no reason. im bitchy because you started it, you fucking wet paper towel. you are blowing this way out of proportion park jisung.</p>
<p>sungie: that was a load of bullshit and you know it.</p>
<p>sungie: people used to tell us our relationship would last forever, beyond our lifetimes</p>
<p>sungie: ha, i guess people can be fucking wrong</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>woah wait what the fuck is going on (private chat between marklee and leehyuck)</p>
<p>markus: so here’s the plan</p>
<p>markus: a lot more new people signed up so we kinda have to organize them all</p>
<p>markus: im not gonna add them to the other gc bc well first off its dead now bc chensung and second of all i feel like that would be so many people ngdkldjf</p>
<p>markus: chensung already requested to be together before they uhh “broke up” so since they need to make up already and d a t e lets just say that we already submitted their tutoring schedule if they ask why we did that</p>
<p>markus: their class would be basically comprised of the wannabe idols who love jisung bc of his yt platform,, singing and dancing, so its a perfect class to join</p>
<p>hyuckus: wow my chensung heart is quaking</p>
<p>markus: i dont know that much about norenmin,, other than what junnie told me ofc,, you have most of the inside info</p>
<p>markus: so whats your decision about them?</p>
<p>hyuckus: ok so</p>
<p>hyuckus: lets put norenmin all together,, bc they can do a theater thing </p>
<p>hyuckus: jeno can do the acting part, renjun can do the singing and sets, jaemin can do the choreo ! </p>
<p>hyuckus: its lowkey perfect,, and it’ll put norenmin together !!</p>
<p>markus: thats great you’re a genius</p>
<p>hyuckus: thank you i try</p>
<p>markus: im gonna send the list of all the tutors here</p>
<p>markus: freshmen: chenle jisung <br/>              sophomores: jeno donghyuck jaemin renjun felix<br/>              juniors: mark yukhei changbin<br/>              seniors: jungwoo sicheng jaehyun ten dongyoung kun jungkook jennie changkyun lisa</p>
<p>markus: chenle and jisung are together obviously </p>
<p>markus: same with norenmin</p>
<p>hyuckus: i guess we have to put yukhei and jungwoo together or they’ll kill us</p>
<p>markus: another idol type class then, singing and rapping</p>
<p>hyuckus: and lets pun kun and jennie together, lit vocals and nice rap skills</p>
<p>markus: well that works and they’re good friends too so its good</p>
<p>markus: and then i was thinking changkyun and lisa? both senior rapping icons id join that class</p>
<p>hyuckus: n i c e </p>
<p>markus: and then jaehyun and jungkook</p>
<p>hyuckus: theyd be so,, broey tho</p>
<p>hyuckus: do you know one time i was going to felix’s locker to ask about something and jaehyun and jungkook were there and they said the word bro at least thirty times and it was a two minute conversation </p>
<p>markus: well they’re bros and if you seperate the bros jaehyun would choke me </p>
<p>markus: also the only person taeyong trusts to be alone with jaehyun hours on end is jungkook</p>
<p>hyuckus: true ok well thats a vocalist class </p>
<p>hyuckus: and im sorry but i really need dongyoung and ten to be together</p>
<p>hyuckus: they fucking hate eachother do you know how funny that would be </p>
<p>markus: DKDSJKDSJKS whY DID I NOT THINK OF THAT</p>
<p>hyuckus: twO ART STUDENTS IT WOULD MAKE A PERFECT CLASS</p>
<p>markus: weLL THATS AMAZING DONGYOUNG IS GONNA FLIP</p>
<p>hyuckus: and then lets put changlix together the tension is u n r e a l</p>
<p>markus: omg changbin wont shut up about felix in music theory asnflsj</p>
<p>markus: oh shitt </p>
<p>hyuckus: what ?? </p>
<p>markus: yknow jeongin? the cute freshman with the braces</p>
<p>hyuckus: aww i love him</p>
<p>hyuckus: he came up to me one day and complimented my yt vids so uwu </p>
<p>markus: yeah well he signed up too but he was lowkey late bc ortho appointment</p>
<p>markus: hes adorable tho so i said sure </p>
<p>markus: but where do we p U T H I M </p>
<p>hyuckus: lightbulb ! </p>
<p>markus: wow you’re really comin up with all the good ideas today</p>
<p>hyuckus: you havent even heard it ahahah</p>
<p>markus: im sure its amazing anyway</p>
<p>hyuckus: aww</p>
<p>hyuckus: well anyway i have jeongin’s number bc choir club and stuff</p>
<p>hyuckus: and both of chensung are so fucking on edge now so they probably wont tell anyone their problems </p>
<p>hyuckus: jeongin is a sweet kid he can tell us whats going on with chensung !! so lets put him there for the tea and he can mediate them too </p>
<p>hyuckus: hes not really a rapper but he can cover it pretty well so that class really will be a wholeass idol one</p>
<p>markus: see i was right</p>
<p>markus: it is an A M A Z I N G idea </p>
<p>hyuckus: aww thank you i try</p>
<p>markus: so the final group list is:</p>
<p>markus: chensung + jeongin - idol type class<br/>              norenmin -theater<br/>  luwoo - idol<br/>  jaehyun and jungkook - singing <br/>  dongyoung and ten - art<br/>  kun and jennie - idol<br/>  changkyun and lisa (rapping legends alsdfladjf) - rap<br/>  changlix - rap<br/>  markhyuck - lit songwriting, producing, singing, and rapping classes </p>
<p>hyuckus: o we’re gonna be together?</p>
<p>markus: oh you dont wanna be?? sorry for putting us together i just assumed,, </p>
<p>hyuckus: nO</p>
<p>hyuckus: no</p>
<p>hyuckus: it would be amazing to work with you</p>
<p>markus: i feel like we could really explore songwriting and producing and how the process works in our classes</p>
<p>hyuckus: yeah that would be gr9</p>
<p>markus: now i gtg bc wrestling practice see ya hyuckie !!</p>
<p>hyuckus: yeap see you too markle</p>

<p>dance legend: we can just plan our next lessons and stuff !! ik we didnt really plan anything for the first lesson which is happening in like,, two hours,, but!! since its like the first day of many we can just uhh do some games or something </p>
<p>all around legend: yeah that sounds good bc i didnt have anything planned either haha</p>
<p>all around legend: ok bro</p>
<p>all around legend: i know you and chenle had a huge ass fight but,, we gotta add him to this chat </p>
<p>all around legend: i dont wanna get in the middle of whatever you guys are dealing with </p>
<p>all around legend: so please try not to start shit and bring me in the middle of it? </p>
<p>dance legend: yeah fine i cant ask you to be exclusively on one side or another</p>
<p>dance legend: but we’re probably both gonna be hella passive aggressive knowing that shithead</p>

<p>jeonginy changed jeonginy to: jeongin<br/>jeonginy changed leehyuck to: hyuck<br/>jeonginy changed marklee to: mark</p>
<p>jeongin: is there ANY WAY i can change my fuCKING PARTNERS? </p>
<p>mark: omg jeongin im so so so so so so so sorry that you have to deal with them</p>
<p>mark: what did they do now </p>
<p>jeongin: haHA</p>
<p>jeongin: HAHAHAHAHA</p>
<p>jeongin: they spent the entire time only calling eachother by full names</p>
<p>jeongin: and then adding something like, “bitchass” or “fucknugget” or something loudly whispered after</p>
<p>hyuck: lmao who said fucknugget</p>
<p>jeongin: chenle</p>
<p>hyuck: AHAHAHAH FIGURES</p>
<p>jeongin: ok im glad you’re finding this funny hyung but im dyING OVER HERE HELP ME????</p>
<p>hyuck: OH RIGHT IM SO SORRY JEONGINNIE</p>
<p>mark: theres really no way to change the partners now unless you drop out of tutoring,,</p>
<p>jeongin: nah i dont wanna do that its actually pretty fun??</p>
<p>hyuck: ok well since you cant drop out wanna rant about them instead?</p>
<p>jeongin: get ready bitches</p>
<p>jeongin: hyungs**</p>
<p>jeongin: well ok first of all, as soon as we walked in, chenle and jisung made me stand in between both of them, and all they did was casually whisper to me about how i was being such a good friend in helping them deal with the other one</p>
<p>jeongin: and then when the other people started coming in we decided to do some get to know you games, so we did the one where you were paired up with someone and you went back and forth saying one word about eachother</p>
<p>jeongin: lo and behold the jar we used to pick names from hates me bc it put chensung together</p>
<p>jeongin: and all chenle and jisung did were go like: <br/>	     chenle: untrustworthy<br/>	     jisung: betrayer<br/>	     chenle: bitch<br/>             jisung: dumbass<br/>             chenle: worthless piece of shit<br/>             jisung: thats two words, dumbass<br/>            chenle: and you already used dumbass, you fucking asswipe</p>
<p>jeongin: basically it wasnt good </p>
<p>jeongin: some of the more innocent freshies were scarred for life</p>
<p>jeongin: and then it got super emo bc</p>
<p>jeongin: i gave up on the games and was just like “yeah lets just uhhh introduce ourselves normally”</p>
<p>jeongin: and chenle went first and he was like, “my name is zhong chenle, i like to sing and its basically all ive ever known, my spirit animal is a dolphin and my best friend is,, uhh,,”</p>
<p>jeongin: and there was an awkward silence and chenle looked like he wanted to cry</p>
<p>jeongin: so did jisung tbh </p>
<p>jeongin: he skipped his intro bc he had to “go to the bathroom” it was basically a mess</p>
<p>jeongin: and i literally just gave up and started the lesson anyway</p>
<p>jeongin: jisung came back and immediately started hating on chenle</p>
<p>jeongin: who started riPPING INTO JISUNG</p>
<p>jeongin: actually im p sure that most of the people at that practice were just here from drama</p>
<p>jeongin: anyway it was really really bad </p>
<p>jeongin: they kept arguing and then being really emo and then one was pissed and the other was sad and it kept going back and forth and ughhhh i just hate the situation honestly i feel bad but i also want them to get their shit together</p>
<p>mark: ohmyfuckinggod</p>
<p>mark: im sorry that we lowkey threw you into this situation jeongin</p>
<p>hyuck: oml those two will be the death of me </p>
<p>hyuck: jeonginnie, im so so so so so so so sorry is there anything i can do to make it up to you?</p>

<p>bi kings gc (private gc with chenle, donghyuck, and renjun)</p>
<p>chenle: donGHYUCKIE/INJUNNIE HYUNG</p>
<p>donghyuck: yes my son </p>
<p>chenle: what the heCKLE happened with mark hyung i wanna know the teaaa hes in the practice room connected to the music hall so whenever everyone gets quiet you can hear him rapping about how he’s “fucking gay as shit” </p>
<p>renjun: ok sO</p>
<p>renjun: this girl,, idk if you know her,,</p>
<p>renjun: her name is ashley she’s johnny hyung’s cousin?? they moved from america together</p>
<p>chenle: nah idk her</p>
<p>donghyuck: she’s the one who helped jae eun ask out yuta hyung two years ago and thats when he told everyone that he and sicheng were dating</p>
<p>donghyuck: jae eun slapped her bc she thought that ashley was just trying to humiliate her</p>
<p>chenle: oH YEAH i heard about her </p>
<p>chenle: so what about her?</p>
<p>renjun: she asked out mark hyung today</p>
<p>renjun: like she went on to the stage in the auditorium, started singing i like me better by lauv really off key, and then said, “mark lee, will you go out with me?”</p>
<p>donghyuck: damn i wish i could have seen that curse my schedule for giving me a different lunch period </p>
<p>chenle: damn same</p>
<p>renjun: and then mark like kinda pulled her to the side of the cafeteria, and everything was dead quiet bc everyone wanted to hear what he had to say</p>
<p>renjun: and i think mark was focusing so much on how to let her down gently that he didnt notice that everyone could hear them</p>
<p>renjun: and he was like</p>
<p>chenle: im on the edGE OF MY SEAT JUNNIE HYUNG</p>
<p>renjun: “im really really sorry ashley you’re a really nice girl but i cant date you”</p>
<p>renjun: and she was like, “but why?? is it bc johnny is my cousin? ill tell him to fuck off!”</p>
<p>renjun: and mark said, “well i mean dating johnny hyungs cousin is still kinda weird but no thats not the reason”</p>
<p>renjun: and then she was like “then why? do you like anyone else? another girl?”</p>
<p>renjun: and then mark was probably losing patience by then bc he was like </p>
<p>renjun: “nah its because im literally so gay. just so so so so gay. like into guys yknow”</p>
<p>renjun: and ashley was like “o”</p>
<p>renjun: “oops”</p>
<p>renjun: and then she ran away bc she realized that everyone was staring and mark was like “oh shit what do i do”</p>
<p>renjun: and i walked up to him and told him to just sit down honestly its not like talking to ashley would have made it better</p>
<p>renjun: and we just left the cafeteria and went to the courtyard where ashley coINCIDENTALLY was</p>
<p>renjun: and she just fucking bolted wow</p>
<p>renjun: and yeah thats the story</p>
<p>donghyuck: wait.</p>
<p>donghyuck: renjunnie</p>
<p>donghyuck: when mark said, “nah its bc im gay” after ashley asked him that</p>
<p>donghyuck: do you think he said nah bc he was answering, “another girl?” or nah bc he was answering, “do you liek smone else”</p>
<p>renjun: i think it was another girl tbh bc he did the big ass sigh thing when it got to that part</p>
<p>chenle: ive known mark hyung for a long ass time and he definitely seems into you hyuck hyung</p>
<p>chenle: trust me</p>
<p>chenle: dont dwell on this shit for too long</p>
<p>renjun: speaking of love lives</p>
<p>renjun: mine is shitty rn </p>
<p>donghyuck: dont worry my “plans” are working great</p>
<p>chenle: plans?</p>
<p>renjun: remember how i told you ab how jeno liked jaemin? well he asked me and hyuck to help him get jaemin, and hyuck keeps making “genius” plans </p>
<p>renjun: but then he ruins them on purpose</p>
<p>chenle: how how howwwww</p>
<p>chenle: this is prime t e a </p>
<p>donghyuck: there was one time that i forgot to tell jaemin to come early and meet up with jeno</p>
<p>donghyuck: and then i said id help them get together at the actual tutoring thing when instead i just kinda uhhh kept pulling minnie away</p>
<p>donghyuck: today i said id let them be partners for our math proj but i bribed felix to ask jeno instead </p>
<p>donghyuck: during lunch i said that id text jaemin for him bc i know how to flirt with jaemin bc im his bsf i know what he likes</p>
<p>donghyuck: but i pretended to get locked out of jenos phone and disabled it for one hour bc “i definitely remembered the password” </p>
<p>donghyuck: today jeno asked jaemin to go get coffee together of his own volition and told me ab it but im gonna tell my mom to call the na’s over for dinner bc “we havent seen them in thirty years”</p>
<p>donghyuck: im really good at screwing shit up i deserve a raise</p>
<p>renjun: wow hyuck im actually lowkey proud</p>
<p>chenle: we love one king ! honestly tho thats really smart i wouldnt be able to keep it up for this long without anyone noticing</p>
<p>chenle: speaking of noticing</p>
<p>chenle: i notice that i miss jisung a lot</p>
<p>donghyuck: i heard ab what happened at your class</p>
<p>chenle: and its only gotten worse since then</p>
<p>chenle: he keeps making quick jabs at me in class like we were asked to talk about the moral of the story and examples of lessons that could be in books and stuff</p>
<p>chenle: and jisung was like “sometimes people you thought were your friends turn on you, so you should be careful with who you surround yourself with”</p>
<p>chenle: and he looked right at me and so did everyone else</p>
<p>chenle: i almost cried but yknow me i cant let shit go bc im a little bitch</p>
<p>chenle: and i went “another thing that could be the lesson is that sometimes you need to be aware of other people’s emotions and feelings, and not shut out from the world, so you can avoid causing intense damage to people that care about you “</p>
<p>chenle: everyone started staring at jisung who looked at me with a really weird expression i couldnt tell what he was feeling</p>
<p>donghyuck: guilt?</p>
<p>renjun: regret?</p>
<p>chenle: probably neither</p>
<p>donghyuck: talk to jeongin ab this</p>
<p>donghyuck: he sees yall every day maybe he’ll know</p>
<p>renjun: ^^</p>
<p>chenle: not a bad idea</p>
<p>chenle: thanks you guys!! this gc is dead sometimes but i honestly love how much better yall make me feel</p>
<p>renjun: yeah same like i trust you guys a lot im glad this tutoring thing happened</p>
<p>donghyuck: same i love you guys so much </p>

<p>im so sorry (private chat between jeonginy and zhonglele)</p>
<p>zhonglele: im so so sorry jeongin</p>
<p>jeonginy changed jeonginy to: in<br/>jeonginy changed zhonglele to: lele</p>
<p>in: i feel like if i got famous or smthing this would be my name</p>
<p>in: what are you sorry for?</p>
<p>lele: get ready this is a long ass rant</p>
<p>in: yes ofc im here </p>
<p>lele: ive been an actually trash friend these past few weeks. to you, to jisung, to daehwi, to hyejoo, honestly everyone. i was a bitch to jisung for no actual reason other than i thought that he was mad at me, and i just couldnt communicate to him well enough causing our entire friendship to fall apart. now we’re just bitchy af to each other and i cant even articulate it. he pulls some shit with me which he has every right to and i cant even be the bigger person and let it go. i always have to be a dickwad back. and putting you and other people in the middle of our fights was the absolute shittiest thing ive done. i really dont deserve any of the people who supported me in these past few weeks bc im the shithead here. i literally couldnt talk to my BEST FRIEND well enough that i ruined the partner tutoring for all of the other kids and you, who had to save everyone and even worse i almost cried today in class and there too all because i cant handle all the shit i did to myself. im such a fucking horrible person i dont deserve any of the friends i have or had. can i really blame jisung for leaving? and today,, i couldnt even decipher what he was thinking. ive grown that far apart from my best friend in just over a WEEK. i dont even know what his facial expressions mean anymore. i dont even know who he is. i barely know who i am anymore. idk what happened. i usually wouldnt be this horrible. im starting with you. im so sorry</p>
<p>in: you havent been a trash friend or person lele. no one, not any of us, expected you to be nice and perfect with us, considering that you just had the biggest fight youve ever had with your best friend since yall were little. we all expected to be lowkey put in the middle, yeah sure, we wanted you guys to reconcile and shit but we needed you to get your own closure. we would have given yall like another week at eachothers throats before locking you into the music room together lmao but honestly chenle. miscommunication happens in all relationships, even the most picturesque ones. you both made mistakes, thats why its miscommunication. it happens on BOTH sides of the relationship, platonic or otherwise. both of you insulted eachother, it is really not on JUST you, its on both of you. and you didnt do anY of this shit to yourself. you both did it to eachother, sometimes you will argue, this one was just big as fuck. and its ok. you both obviously regret it, which brings me to my next point. </p>
<p>in: the look on jisungs face in class.</p>
<p>in: to be honest, jisung isnt a very open person and you know it. you always seemed to be the one who could read him the best, right? but honestly its hard to read a mix of emotions. i only know what he was feeling bc he came to hyerin samuel and i in comp sci the next period. he told the other two what happened and what happened. he started ranting about how he really didnt mean to make you feel like shit and he was feeling like shit bc you obviously were feeling like shit and this is such a shitstorm honestly bby i think you need to talk shit out with sung. you both obviously dont want this to continue any longer than it already has.</p>
<p>lele: nglsjlgjsld your the actual best jeongin ily and ur right. this has gone on far far too long for a bullshit reason im gonna apologize today</p>
<p>in: you’re*</p>
<p>in: and np lele &lt;3</p>
<p>lele: damn i really cant hold a grudge for a long time</p>
<p>lele: this was the longest one and its been like a week</p>
<p>in: thats a good thing lmao</p>
<p>lele: thank you for the motivation and shit you’re such a good friend to me </p>

<p>rosé: i have a question</p>
<p>rosé: i feel like these are wrong</p>
<p>rosé: personality wise isnt jeno a lot like jennie? people think hes a bitch but hes actually a sweetheart on the inside</p>
<p>jisoo: ha maybe</p>
<p>jennie: and hyuck is a lot like jisoo right? hes always the one who makes our group hangouts more fun</p>
<p>rosé: woW you’re right </p>
<p>lisa: im having an identity crisis</p>
<p>jennie: i feel like renjun is rosé tho</p>
<p>jennie: then im lisa!! </p>
<p>jisoo: ha yeah anyway minnie!! where are we going for tonight??</p>
<p>jennie: oh no sorry jeno i cant,, donghyuck’s family and my family are having dinner together!!</p>
<p>jisoo: o</p>
<p>jisoo: its k </p>
<p>jennie: im really really sorry its just that this is really important to me</p>
<p>jisoo: nah its fine</p>
<p>jisoo: i just didnt know that donghyuck had a crush on jaemin. </p>
<p>lisa: that i had a what. </p>
<p>jennie: jeno what? donghyuck does NOT like me. </p>
<p>rosé: what the hell. </p>
<p>jisoo: no it makes perfect sense im sorry jaemin. its just so obvious. he SAID he would help me get you to date me but all he’s doing is messing up every opportunity he gets. he makes good plans then screws them up on purpose because he has a huge crush on you. he literally disabled my phone so i couldnt talk to you, and when i finally asked you out you SUDDENLY have a dinner party together? i bet you if you called his mom and asked he was the one who arranged it. so of COURSE he likes you. im sorry you had to find out this way. </p>
<p>rosé: you shouldnt be sorry to jaemin? you should be sorry to donghyuck for spreading shitty rumours that have barely any basis. </p>
<p>jisoo: i doubt that all of that had no basis, and i didnt even list it all. and i bet YOU knew about it. i trusted you injun. you knew all about this but didnt even think to tell me or warn me about it. wow. </p>
<p>jennie: hold up, all of you. </p>
<p>jennie: donghyuck, you tried to set me up with someone? and didnt even tell me?</p>
<p>lisa: obviously, jaemin, i messed it all up? and trust me, its not because i like you.</p>
<p>jennie: i know you dont like me. but why didnt you TELL me that any of this was going on? chenle and jisung fought over something stupid and dumb, but at least they dont pawn their friends off like a piece of meat without telling them. </p>
<p>lisa: what the fuck. jaemin, i obviously DIDNT DO THAT. I SCREWED IT ALL UP.</p>
<p>jennie: still? you knew someone was into me and didnt tell me, your friend since birth. and the intention was still there. i cant believe you. but im not done with you all yet. </p>
<p>jennie: huang injun.</p>
<p>rosé: its renjun. </p>
<p>jennie: you knew? about all of this? everything? donghyuck making plans. jeno liking me. all of it?</p>
<p>rosé: yeah.</p>
<p>jennie: you’re no better than the rest of them.</p>
<p>jennie: i dont even know what to say to jeno. </p>

<p>jisoo: because i like jaemin and friends are supposed to tell you anything they know about the development of your crush?</p>

<p>norenminhyuck arent done with eachother yet. i feel like their huge fight got diminished a little because of chensung and minor markhyuck which is ok because they'll be shady next chapter (ok maybe some slight spoilers from me today)</p>

to get a glass of water, and sees two bodies pressed up against the wall of the next room. they are furiously typing on both of their phones. taeyong smirks and sits back down, whispering the
