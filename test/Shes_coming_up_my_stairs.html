<div id="chapters" class="userstuff">
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>I remember when I was younger,<br/>
my mother would say,<br/>
"be a good boy,<br/>
and don't stay up late.<br/>
If you disobey, my child, she will come,<br/>
and take you to a place without your dear mum."</p><p>"Who is she?" I would ask,<br/>
with wonder, no fear.<br/>
She told me of a little girl,<br/>
but she was not mere.<br/>
I thought it was silly,<br/>
even as a child,<br/>
and stayed up anyway,<br/>
completely in denial.</p><p>When I was eight,<br/>
there were no phones,<br/>
we had books and lanterns,<br/>
and old itchy clothes.</p><p>But that was good enough for us,<br/>
our imaginations big,<br/>
full of dragons, fairies and witches,<br/>
who turned men to pigs.</p><p>However one night, as I was up oh so late,<br/>
the eight year old me heard a strange noise from the lake.<br/>
It was raining too hard to make out perfectly,<br/>
but I heard squelches of footprints with absolute certainty. </p><p>Between the harsh rain drops that clicked against the windows glass,<br/>
I could've sworn I heard a pot outside violently smash.</p><p>My candle light was flickering,<br/>
as if it wanted to escape,<br/>
I wanted to run away too,<br/>
but I knew it was too late. </p><p>Even as a child my mind held logic,<br/>
I knew it could be anything out there, but I am in a house,<br/>
I should be safe locked in here.</p><p>The fairies in my book soared,<br/>
the dragons did roar,<br/>
the princes saved the princesses,<br/>
with their long metal swords.</p><p>The rain wouldn't stop clicking, tapping on my window,<br/>
trying to get my attention and coo me over.<br/>
I stayed put, wrapped up in my blankets,<br/>
book in one hand,<br/>
candle in other.</p><p>Fear kept an icy grip on my spin,<br/>
sending pricks down the skin in tight, long lines. </p><p>I remember it so clearly,<br/>
a strong metallic scent,<br/>
mixing with the waxy, smoke of the candle on my bed.</p><p>It was in my house now,<br/>
my candle was trembling,<br/>
crying wax as the sky roared for me to start escaping.</p><p>I set the candle onto my bedside table, and dove under my blankets,<br/>
wanting to hide from the eyes that searched for me in this darkness.</p><p>Now I hear it,<br/>
it sounds so close,<br/>
the sticky padding up the stairs,<br/>
the sound I didn't want to hear the most.</p><p>It's coming up my stairs.</p><p>I peeked my head out,<br/>
from under the rough material,<br/>
only to dive back underneath,<br/>
wanting to escape this potentialÂ  serial murderer.</p><p>I closed my eyes tight,<br/>
but regretted it as so as I did,<br/>
I saw her coming up my stairs,<br/>
but she was just a little kid. </p><p>However, her face was not human,<br/>
but that of a garden gnome,<br/>
it's hollow eyes staring blankly up at me,<br/>
it's hat like a cone.</p><p>I let out a scream,<br/>
ripping off the blankets,<br/>
my eyes opened and I saw her in front of me just standing.</p><p>"No no!" I remember crying out.</p><p>"Take me when I'm older!<br/>
When I have nothing more.<br/>
When fairies in my books no longer soar,<br/>
when the dragons cease to roar,<br/>
when the princes stop saving their princesses, using their swords. </p><p>When rain stops falling and flames no longer shine.<br/>
When mothers stop caring and children don't lie.<br/>
Take me, when I'm ready to die."</p><p>I realise now, she isn't to be feared.<br/>
My mother never told the eight year old me that my death was drawing near. </p><p>She only hugged me goodnight,<br/>
with tears in her eyes,<br/>
thinking this would be my last day alive.<br/>
And father let me read my stories, so I could die with a smile.</p><p>The one I begged was death,<br/>
and we made a deal.<br/>
And now as I type this,<br/>
I see her walk closer, toe then heal. </p><p>My fairies won't stop soaring,<br/>
my dragons will roar,<br/>
my princes will save all my princesses,<br/>
with their long metal swords.</p><p>Candles with shine and rain will fall,<br/>
even when death knocks at my door.</p><p>Mothers will care and children will lie, but nevertheless, I am now ready to die.</p>
