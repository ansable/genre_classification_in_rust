    <p>Summary</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Deane Mason, a soldier in Earth’s army, crashes on an uninhabited planet, and the figure of her long-dead brother appears to her, pulling her out of the wreckage of her ship. But Lee isn't the man she remembers. As Deane struggles to cling to life with Lee watching over her, she struggles, too, to remember why her life matters. A single cog in the machine of war.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Notes</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>So this is something I wrote for a big project that won't see the light of day until, oh, September? So I figured I'd go ahead and share it since it'll be a couple weeks until the big fic I've been working on is ready! &lt;3<br/>CW for blood, violence, death.</p></blockquote>

      <p>
  <span>A hiss of smoke seeped from the forward console, curling past the flashing red lights that pulsed like a heartbeat around her. Ears ringing from the impact, it took her a few pained moments of consciousness to recognize that echoing, bleating alarm, the one that meant the hull integrity was compromised. No great shock. Somewhere in the murky black back of her mind, she remembered the torpedo, bursting through her shields and ship as easily as if it were tearing through paper. She'd only taken out two enemy fighters before she had been hit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her commander was going to kill her, if gravity hadn’t done the job for him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The seatbelt dug into her chest and torso, and when she blinked away the thick fog over her eyes, she saw blood before she saw anything else. Splatters of it painted the cracked window of her ship, the bright glare of sunlight outside casting morbid shadows over the cockpit. Under the sound of the alarm, she thought she could hear the gentle </span>
  <em>
    <span>tap, tap, tap</span>
  </em>
  <span> of her wounds dripping on the shattered metal beneath her, but maybe it was just her imagination. It was so hard to think, to breathe through the steam, and her vision was splotched with black and white and red. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh bug,” a sweet, familiar voice said by her ear. She felt a hand rest on her shoulder, and — as though lifting the weight of the world — Deane managed to lift her head to meet her brother’s eyes. “You aren’t in good shape,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>New pain shone through the agony; her heart ached at the sight of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wore the flight suit they’d buried him in, the same gray jacket and rank-striped sleeves, the same metal-toed boots, the same Earth’s Army insignia — the same uniform she herself wore. But his skin wasn’t slashed and torn and charred as it was when she saw him last. Rather, he looked boyish, healthy, young, even through the haze. Though her fingers were aching where she'd gripped the steering console too hard, she clasped the hand on her shoulder and squeezed, trying to say his name. It came out a cough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a gentle shake of his head, he knelt in front of her, pulling out of her grip in order to wrestle with the buckle of her seatbelt. His knuckles brushed bruises where the clasp had dug in under her chest, and she recoiled as those hands approached the massive gash along her stomach and side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh bug,” he said again, and the belt came free. Her body sagged without the support. “You’ve hurt yourself. And I don’t think your ship is going to work anymore.” She blinked at him, confused, stomach churning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course it won’t,” she managed to say, swallowing a slick, metallic slug of blood around the words. Holding back the urge to vomit, she rolled her head back against the seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s get you out of here.” A hand rested on her knee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she snapped, tossing a weak arm at her brother as if to fight him off. “No, if this is — if I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>dying</span>
  </em>
  <span> —” Taking a deep breath, she tried to steady the shake of shock in her limbs. “Don’t take me away just yet.” She was crying, she realized then, hot tears carving streams down her bloodied face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” he asked, cocking his head. The gesture was strange for him, almost childlike.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If this is the — the afterlife, I don’t want to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He let out a bark of a laugh, then reached up to brush a wayward lock of hair from over her eye. It felt heavy with caked blood. Everything felt heavy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t the afterlife,” he said with a smile. “It’s a planet. Here. I’ll show you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She would have fought him if she were able. As he fit his arm under the crook of her legs and the other behind her back — as he lifted her out of her seat and straightened in the low cockpit — she realized with a flash of searing pain that she may have broken her legs. She may have broken much more than her legs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lee,” she groaned at the shift and the clench of his fingers. Every beat of her heart throbbed through her body, and she felt hot blood soaking her jacket, seeping into his.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He carried her out of the cockpit toward the busted-open side of the hull, stepping over fallen equipment and the screws and rivets that stuck out of the twisted metal flooring. The light grew even brighter as they moved into the open air, and she squeezed her eyes shut, pressing her head against his chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smelled like blood, like the fumes that had flooded the cockpit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay, bug,” he said, and he knelt, lowering her to the ground. The noise of the alarm had faded now, a faint backdrop to a sound she couldn’t immediately identify —  perhaps the chirping of unknown insects, or wildlife. Wind, at least. She knew she could hear the wind sure as she felt it on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deane managed to crack open her eyes as Lee laid her gently down. It took a few moments for her sight to adjust under the bright sunlight, for her to make out the outline of looming, craggy, red-rock mountains against the horizon, near enough to walk to — if she could walk. The sky gleamed in hues of yellow and white, bathed in the light of two suns, too bright for her to see, though she knew they existed. They had been fighting in this system — fighting over this planet, in fact. The mountains held ore, and the plains…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The plains stretched far in all directions, a flat expanse spiked with wide, dun-green shards of grass that folded beneath her as she settled onto the ground. The landscape lay dotted with brief shrubs, spiked and twisted things that looked more like pale tangles of steel wool than anything natural. To the side, where she managed to turn her head as she laid it in Lee’s offered lap, a little cluster of trees grew, stoney white bark barely standing out against the hue of the sky. Their leaves waved lazily in the quiet wind, like a flag of surrender.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tried to school her lungs into some kind of even in-and-out, and Lee began to stroke the crown of her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “See, a planet. No afterlife. Not for a little while yet.” He paused, his fingers curling into the matted strands of her hair. “I’m glad you’re here,” he admitted. “I’ve been alone a very long time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sting of guilt shot through her, another layer of pain, and she took in a shaky breath, watching the breeze tickle the tips of the wide grass. Tiny, jewel-bright bugs hopped from blade to blade. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll see you again soon if I don’t get some help,” she said quietly. “Is there no one else here?” If this were an afterlife, or even a gateway, wouldn’t there be others? Their parents? Lee’s partner? Deane’s lost friends?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, people come and go,” Lee said. “Some ships came to mine the ore. Some came to cut down the trees. That was a long time ago. I didn’t speak with their people. They wore —” he paused. “They wore these suits. Big suits. Scary.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lee wasn’t scared of anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should call the ship, make sure they can find me.” Deane said. She tried to shift, but pain tore through her side, and she flopped back onto Lee’s lap. Even that small impact sent shockwaves through her. Hands trembling, she clamped down on her wound the best she could, chest heaving. “C — call the ship?” she managed to grunt out through gritted teeth. “Can’t move.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no,” he said softly as Deane began to breathe through the pain. “You’ll be dead long before they get to you. No, no, just relax here with me. You don’t want to go back there anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had a point. It </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> peaceful here. Better than lying on an examination table under dim blue lights. Better than breathing the sharp scent of fuel and chemicals that permeated the fleet’s warships. That was how Lee had died, convulsing under a medic’s thick, war-roughened hands. Maybe Lee was doing her a kindness, letting her die out here in the breeze, gilded with the glow of the sky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is a shame, though,” Lee said after a moment, untangling her bloodied hair. “You’ll die before we have a chance to get to know each other.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deane wished she could muster a laugh. “What are you talking about?” she asked. “You know me better than anyone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gazed up at his familiar face, haloed by sun, looking confused. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t,” he said. “I only know what I saw in your head. And your head is very messy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In spite of the planet’s heat, the wind turned cold against her skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you talking about?” She asked again, her heart pounding out an alarm. “You’re my brother. You know me better than — than anyone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Comprehension bloomed on Lee’s face, and he leaned back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” he mused, closing his eyes for a moment. “I — well, I can see why you would think that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lee?” She managed. It wasn’t the question she wanted to ask. He looked to her with a kind, small smile and hefted a breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh bug,” he said on a sigh. Careful not to jostle her, he removed his uniform jacket, bundled it up, and slipped out from under her. Then, he lowered her onto the bloodied fabric, as delicately as if she were made of glass. In her state, she could only submit to the movement, her body trembling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lee?” she asked again, urgently this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> With warm, steady hands, he moved hers out of the way and pressed down on her wound, damming the flood better than she could. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a moment for him to speak. When he did, his voice was low, heavy with regret.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry, bug,” he finally said. “I didn't mean to confuse you. I just took this form so I could talk to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This — this </span>
  <em>
    <span>form</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. I found this shape in your memories while you were sleeping. You don’t understand?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her vision fading at the edges, Deane inhaled sharply through her nose. She had to slow her pounding heart if she wanted to live much longer, had to calm down, had to quiet the voice in the back of her head that screamed that she was hallucinating — and the warring voice that prayed she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not my brother,” she said. And of course he wasn’t. How could he be? Lee was dead, six years dead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. ” He — </span>
  <em>
    <span>it</span>
  </em>
  <span> — sounded sad.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what the hell are you?” She asked, tears leaking full force once again, her eyes blurring everything in sight into light. Fear reverberated through her. Panic. The human, instinctual drive to protect herself. She had to move, had to fight, had to do </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span>, even if it killed her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>God, it could kill her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A hand moved to her forehead and laid itself there, and the creature closed its eyes as if in prayer. She raised her arm to fight it off just as a wave of calm washed over her like a rush of warm water, something blooming in the back of her mind and promising peace. It eased the tension of her limbs, slowed her heart and urged her lungs to fill with breath. She let out a sob, hand falling back to the ground, choking on the realization that this soothing force hadn’t come from within her. It had come from Lee, from this </span>
  <em>
    <span>thing</span>
  </em>
  <span>, from its gentle touch, familiar and alien all at once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When their eyes met again (those dark eyes so like her own), the creature’s expression softened. “I don’t know what I am,” it said. “I’ve been alone a very long time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It removed its hand from her forehead and pressed on her wound again, harder this time. She whimpered, clenched her fingers into the grainy soil. The creature didn’t seem to notice her distress. Somehow it had soothed the worst of her panic, but the pain was still there. It hurt; </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span> hurt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How?” she asked, taking a steadying breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I found him in your memories,” it explained calmly. “I wanted to find out who you were.” With a thoughtful pause, its face fell, wearing a look of pity the real Lee would never have given her. “You have a very sad mind,” it added, almost as an afterthought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A ‘sad mind.’ Of </span>
  <em>
    <span>course</span>
  </em>
  <span> she did. They all did. Her sadness was hereditary, passed down through generations of soldiers who had lost their friends, their family, their fight — lost it all on the front lines of a war they didn’t even know why they fought, except that they had been ordered to. Lee had been ordered to. Deane had been ordered to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did you choose </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” she asked, swallowing blood and bile and tears and saline sweat, wanting to reach out but feeling far too weak to do so.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because he was in all of the happy memories,” the creature said, and its lips curled in a tiny smile. “I thought you would be happy to see him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Happy. Deane didn’t know when she’d last been happy, but she knew this wasn’t it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm not,” she admitted. “Please let him go. Get out of his body. Be something else, anything else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Brows turning down, the creature stared at her, looking hurt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t understand. You aren’t happy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deane turned her head, tucking her nose into the coarse fabric of Lee’s jacket — an illusion, but it felt real. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m scared,” she choked out, feeling powerless and sick with the fear of the darkness encroaching on her, even as she lay surrounded by light. “What do you want with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to know you,” it said. “I want to know about your people. I — I have been alone a very long time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop saying that,” she snapped, her fingers curling like dead spiders into weak fists at her sides. “And stop using his face, please. Be something else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A moment passed. The breeze carried the scents of unfamiliar dust and vegetation. She thought the light began to shine a bit brighter at the edge of her vision. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But this is the man who sent you to die,” the creature said, and Deane turned to it, jolting when she saw the grizzled and scarred face of her commanding officer staring down at her with open pain written in his canyon-deep wrinkles. “Why would you want me to be him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t!” she shouted. A cough wrenched itself from her lungs and she began to double over, but the creature held her down, still pressing hard on the gash over her stomach. “I don’t,” she said again, voice weak. “I don’t want you to be anything. Call my ship, please. Get me — get me out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want to go back to that place? To this man? You’re not happy,” it said, as if she needed the reminder. Her lungs felt packed with razors as she struggled for breath, bringing a weak hand to her mouth. She couldn’t cry like this in front of her commander. But this wasn’t her commander. It wasn’t anyone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“None of us are happy,” she whispered against her palm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t surprise me,” it said, and it looked away from her, turning its eyes to that imposing mountain range. There was too much light; nothing cast a shadow. “How can you be happy when you fight? In your head I saw explosions. And blood. Horrible things. I’ve never seen blood before I saw yours.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deane let out a gasp as the creature removed its hands from her wound, lifting them to its face, a look of gentle curiosity in its eyes as it examined her blood. She clutched her own stomach once again, pressing down in the absence of the creature's touch. The world was swimming around her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please,” she whispered. “Help me call my ship. I can’t move.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking away and lowering its hands, the creature smiled with the side of its mouth — a sad little tic of lips she had never seen on the commander’s face before. “You </span>
  <em>
    <span>will</span>
  </em>
  <span> die. Whether you call your ship or not,” it said. “You don’t want to go back to that place. It’s horrible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course it is,” she said. Her next words came out a mere rasp of breath, so quiet they seemed to carry themselves away on the wind. “It’s war. But it’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>my</span>
  </em>
  <span> life and I want — I want to go back. Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moments passed — maybe minutes. She couldn’t tell. With each beat of her heart, her blood spilled onto the coarse soil, staining the grass, gleaming with the twin suns’ light. The thought came on her suddenly, the impossible wish that she had died on impact. She didn’t want to see this, to watch her life fade away as she’d watched Lee’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In your head,” the creature said after a time, breaking the silence. It paused, considering, and Deane lifted her heavy eyes to it. “In your head,” it began again. “I saw </span>
  <em>
    <span>so much</span>
  </em>
  <span> love. For your brother and your friends — even </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span> man, the one you call ‘Commander.’” It looked down at its own body in what seemed to be disbelief. “Do all of your people love like this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe,” she said. “I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could they?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, God, </span>
  <em>
    <span>maybe</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I don’t—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would they fight if they can love like you do? People who love can’t fight. Or maybe </span>
  <em>
    <span>shouldn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Wouldn’t they stop if they felt love like this? I would stop. If I loved, I would stop fighting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another emotion had entered the creature’s eyes now, something bright that she didn’t recognize right away. How could she? It had been so long since she’d seen hope.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just a soldier,” she said, her lip trembling with unshed tears. All of her was trembling, every strained cord of her muscles. “I don’t — I don’t know what you want me to say. Love doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>change</span>
  </em>
  <span> anything. We’ve been fighting as long as we can remember.” Even those quiet, choked off words were too much for her empty lungs. She took a deep, shaking breath, letting it out with the certainty that it would be her last. But it wasn’t. Not yet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘Love doesn’t change anything,’” it echoed, something stubborn in its tone. “But </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>love. Why didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> change anything?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t,” she said, but she didn’t know why she needed this creature’s understanding. How could it possibly understand? She’d been trained since birth to take her place in the fight, in the order of things. To inherit the place her parents had vacated when they died. One cog couldn’t break a whole machine, even if it had a will to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My family,” the creature began. It took a long moment’s pause. “My </span>
  <em>
    <span>people</span>
  </em>
  <span> fought too. And died. All of them. A very long time ago. You would do the same.” It was disappointed. In her commander’s voice, the words sounded like an admonishment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s the law of the universe,” she said. “Everything dies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Neither do I.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another beat passed between them, her vision pale around its edges, obscuring the mountain peaks and the waving leaves at her periphery.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wished the creature wouldn't speak again before the fog took her. She wished she could close her eyes and pretend she was back on Earth, on the training grounds where she had run off with Lee and lain in the lawn to watch the clouds roll past. The smell was different, the sounds different, but the wind could have been Earth’s wind. The sunlight could have been Earth’s sun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the creature did speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you see your brother?” it asked. “When you die? You said there was an afterlife.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The thought of Lee, the real Lee, waiting for her somewhere beyond all this, made a small, sad smile tug at her reluctant lips as she looked to the creature. It was him again. Lee. His shape, at least, and he was smiling, too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope so,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The creature brought a hand to her head again, smoothing back her hair, its touch wet with blood but soothing all the same. She felt, then, something twining itself around her consciousness like a thread, curling into her with curiosity and compassion and loneliness so profound she thought she might drown in it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope you do, too,” it said. Or maybe it thought the words because Deane could </span>

    <span>feel</span>
  </em>
  <span> them inside of her, something intrinsic and important and connected. “I am sorry you will die as he did. I am sorry others will die as you did. I am — ” </span>
  <em>
    <span>sadness, determination, hope</span>
  </em>
  <span> — “I am sorry you felt as though you could not change things.” A gust of wind brushed over them, insistent this time, taking Deane’s breath with it, and she let her eyes fall closed over the ghost of her brother's face. “Perhaps you still can,” it finished, but Deane didn't hear it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The creature sat beside Deane’s body for a long time, though time didn't mean much to it anymore. It watched blood redden the soil, watched those parted, unmoving lips and the sweat drying along her brow. The light did change, though it never faded here, the sky yellowing further and casting everything in hues of gold. Even the mountains and their red peaks turned orange. After some long stretch of silence, broken only by that incessant, beeping alarm from the belly of the jet, the creature stood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It breathed once, twice, and in a fracture of light it shifted once more. It had taken what it could of Deane’s mind in those last moments, enough to see what she may look like uninjured, what she might sound like. The things she might say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Stepping over Deane’s body to the rippled remains of the ship, the creature passed through the ruptured hull, the way it had come. The air inside was thick with smoke and fog, but it managed to find the glowing red call button on the wall, standing out from the relative darkness. It slammed its fist — such a strange appendage — against the button and waited.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shit,” a voice crackled over the jet’s last working speaker. “That you, Mason?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” the creature replied in a voice that wasn’t its own. But nothing was its own, not really. “This is Deane Mason. I’ve crashed on —” what did her memories call this place again? It couldn’t recall. “I’ve crashed on the planet. I need an extraction as soon as you can manage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You went down more than an hour ago,” the voice said. “We thought you’d died in the crash. What’s your status?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Out the crack in the hull, the creature watched Deane’s body, still and dark against the bright backdrop of the world in her little nest of grass. It only hesitated for a moment. “Uh, uninjured, but the ship’s done for. No sign of any hostiles. I got lucky.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re pushing back the front line. Hang tight. Shouldn’t be too long.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Static buzzed, and the line went dead. The creature stared at the speaker for a moment, but the smoke burned its new lungs, and that awful beep hurt its new ears. It didn’t want to stay in this broken machine. Soon, it would be surrounded by machines like this. Soon, it would </span>
  <em>
    <span>exist</span>
  </em>
  <span> in a broken machine. A single cog.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wandered back out to Deane, the real Deane, and knelt once more at her side. A smile touched its unfamiliar lips, a smile borne of love and determination. Hope. Possibility.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh bug,” it said, brushing its knuckles gently against her lifeless cheek. “You will change </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
