  <h1>To Come Together</h1>
  <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/dansrusse/pseuds/dansrusse">dansrusse</a></div>
    <p>Summary</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Yagi and Inko get closer after Izuku moves into the dorm, and Inko's only kink is men who love her son. 100% pure smut.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Notes</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Trigger warnings: no condoms. This is what the "unsafe sex" tag is referring to. </p><p>Listen up kiddos: everyone tells you that the boys will whine and cry about using a condom. This is true! But also: condoms suck, and people with vaginas don't like them either. In this, Inko is old enough that getting pregnant is both unlikely, but doable. She basically thinking that if Yagi knocks her up, she legitimately does not care. That being said: use some form of birth control, babies. It's smart. Don't be like Mama.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Inko Midoriya wasn’t sure what she had expected of her son’s idol-turned-mentor, but Yagi Toshinori seemed hellbent on overturning any ideas she might have held.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t difficult when the most unexpected thing he could do was show up in the first place. Men didn’t come around the Midoriya home very often – Inko’s own husband barely lasted a year. He stuck around just long enough to see her go into labor and then was out the door barely a week later. Since him, she really hadn’t had time to date – and, well, whether or not her husband was around, she was a married woman. </p><p>But then Yagi showed up and stuck around which was even more unexpected then his first appearance. Inko could comprehend Yagi’s first visit, but it was hard for her to wrap her mind around the fact that even after Izuku moved into the dorms, Yagi had continued to visit. </p><p>The visits always went the same way: Inko would make them tea, and pull out a package of cookies, and they would snack and chat about the children, and the teachers, and her work.  </p><p>It’s was nice, and that was the third thing about Yagi that was completely unexpected: he was pleasant.</p><p>As much as she respected All Might for the good he did and the people he saved, All Might was loud, showy, and flashy. He made Inko think of one of those European cars with the engines that rumbled even when the car wasn’t moving.</p><p>In almost direct contrast to his public persona, though, Yagi was still, thoughtful, and a little sad. His eyes were deep set into his thin face, and the skin underneath them sagged. His spine curved, and his shoulders slumped.</p><p>He was far from his conventionally attractive former self. Yet, Inko found herself drawn to him. It had been so long since she had had a man’s attention just on her. When Hisahi left there had been no time to pursue company, so she had poured all of her time and energy into her job and Izuku. With Izuku living at school though – well. There were possibilities.</p><p>And it was so, so, hard not to see them in the man who came to her house, and who listened to her fears and worries, and cared about her little boy.</p><p>Yagi was sitting across from her in her living room, tea cup held carefully in one large hand, gesturing with the other animatedly as he regaled her with a story of the hijinks her son’s classmates had gotten up to. She wasn’t really paying attention, distracted by his hands with their dexterous fingers. </p><p>They were so large! The tea cup looked so small in the one hand, and his free hand was so graceful! There was so much that he could do with hands like that…well. She cut off that line of thought before she could follow it to its logical conclusion.</p><p>All of a sudden, Yagi, seemingly having sensed her distraction,  cut off his story, and put down his cup of tea. </p><p>“You’re a very beautiful woman” he said. Inko clapped a hand over her mouth, laughing. </p><p>“You’re very forward!” She said. “And very kind.” She took a breath and then said,” I think you’re handsome, too.”</p><p>He laughed and leaned back on his hands. “You don’t have to say that. I know what I look like now.”</p><p>“No, no,” Inko said, pressing both of her palms down into the table between them. “It’s true. You have such lovely thick hair. And you’re so tall! But-“ she stopped.</p><p>Yagi smiled at her. “By all means, continue.”</p><p>Inko picked up her tea, and took a sip, and then put it back down onto her saucer before folding her hands into her lap to hide how they were shaking. </p><p>“Well – it’s not just- you’re so nice.” She said. “you’re nice to me, and you’re wonderful with Izuku.”</p><p>Yagi smiled at her. ‘You have a lovely son, and he’s going to grow up to be a great man. And a true hero.”</p><p>Inko huffed. “I don’t think you understand how… unusual it is for me to hear that. I can’t possibly thank you enough for all you’ve done for Izuku. Really.”</p><p>Yagi tilted his head. “I’ve gotten him hurt. I’ve put him in the line of danger.”</p><p>“He did that to himself,” Inko said. “And I think you and I both know he would have done the same had he never met you. You said he convinced you by risking his life to save Katsuki – he did that by himself, with no powers. He’s always been like that, diving in and getting hurt. If anything, you’ve given him the means to defend himself. And he has friends now!” Inko began to tear up. “This is everything I could have wanted for him. I’m so, so proud of my little boy!”</p><p>Yagi leaned forward, wiping the tears that gathered under Inko’s eyes. “You should be proud. I can only imagine what you must be feeling. You do such a lovely job looking after your son.  You deserve to have someone look after you too.” </p><p>Inko laughed and looked at the man sitting across from her. “What about you,” she said, grabbing his wrist gently, holding his hand to her face. “You spent so long saving us all, don’t you think you deserve to have someone look after you?”</p><p>“We can compromise,” Yagi said. “We’ll both look after each other and be all the better for it.”</p><p>Inko looked at him then, studying the man in front of her. “I want to be clear here, how exactly are we meant to look after each other?”</p><p>“I think you’re wonderful, Midoriya Inko,” Yagi said. “I would have you in any way you would let me,” he grinned wolfishly. “And I rather hope you will let me have you.”</p><p>“I’m a married woman,” Inko said, laughing.</p><p>“I think it’s time someone treated you like one, don’t you,” Yagi told her, before surging forward and kissing her soundly.</p><p>“You’re the number one hero,” Inko said breathlessly. “Aren’t you worried about the scandal? All Might with a married woman! And a student’s parent, no less!”</p><p>“I’m retired.” He said, still cupping her face In his palms. “I think we can make our own choices, don’t you?”</p><p>Inko smiled, “In that case..” she pulled him towards her, tangling Yagi’s thick hair in her fingers.  “I would rather like to have you in my bed, All Might.” She stood up and turned, walking slowly toward her bedroom. She could hear him scrambling to follow, but didn’t look back, unbuttoning her blouse as she went. She had only just made it to the door frame when he caught up with her.</p><p>Yagi grabbed Inko’s wrist and spun her towards him, pinning her body between himself and her  bed frame. The edge of it pressed into her lower back, and she tilted her hips towards him. She could feel him, his erection pressing up against her. She shivered in delight, and he pushed her backwards, onto her bed, before climbing on top of her.</p><p>“Wait,” she said. He sat back, and she peeled her blouse the rest of the way off. Catching on, Yagi reached forward, and unfastened her bra, pulling it off her. Her breasts swung forward, and he stared at them, mouth open. He held out his palms, and she laughed. “Go ahead, she said,” and he took them gently in his palms, rolling the nipples gently with his thumb before lowering his mouth to one and licking gently.</p><p>All of a sudden, Inko was pushed backwards again, and Yagi was off her, pulling off his own shirt and pants. She stared at him. As whip thin as he was, he was corded with lean muscle – it was all he was made of, skin and bone and pure strength. She reached to her skirt and unzipped it, leaving her in just her underwear. They were plain, light blue cotton, but she was glad they were at least unstained. She thought faintly that she would have to get some nicer ones if this was going to be a more regular occurrence but didn’t have much time to ponder it before Yagi – All Might! was sliding them off and crawling between her legs, kissing his way from her knees up her thighs. </p><p>“I have never seen a more beautiful vision,” he said, spreading her legs further and tracing a stretch mark with his finger, following it with his tongue as he slowly made his way towards her core, kissing and licking everything but, until he finally arrived, and pressed the flat of his tongue against her clit before plunging it deep inside her. </p><p>She moaned, and twisted her arm up behind her, grasping at her pillow, but before she was able to grip it, he hand was around hers. He wove his fingers between hers and held her fast, as his other hand pressed her hip into the mattress, not even pausing one moment his ministrations. His tongue laved over her clit, providing just the right amount of pressure. Inko gasped, and her hips stuttered forward before he pressed her back down. </p><p>She freed her hand from his and pulled his head away.</p><p>“Come up here, I want to kiss you. And I don’t want to come before you’re inside of me”</p><p>“Oh, is that so,” Yagi said, climbing up her body – “In that case…”</p><p>“I don’t have any condoms,” Inko said. “And doubt you do either. Just…pull out before you come?”</p><p>He looked at her, his blue eyes sharp on her own. “Are you sure?” </p><p>Inko laughed. “I think I’m old enough that it’s good enough.” She arched her back and wrapped one leg behind Yagi pulling him closer. “Now get inside of me,” she breathed.</p><p>He grinned, obliging her, and pushed. </p><p>She moaned, and tilted her hips up, as he began rocking into her. Inko bit her lip, and reached up to tug at his hair, pulling him down into a deep, searing kiss. Every one of her nerves was on fire. She wasn’t sure if it was because of how long it’d been, but she had never felt anything quite like this. It was like her entire body had been lit up, the warmth radiating from ever point their bodies connected, and flooding her body until there was nothing else, just her, and Yagi, and everything was warm and perfect, and she was completely overwhelmed, shuddering into him then melting down into the mattress as he pulled out just in time to spend across her stomach before collapsing next to her. </p><p>She reached over, and took his hand, smiling at the man lying next to her with his eyes closed, panting. </p><p>This, she thought, was just the start.</p>
