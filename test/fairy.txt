HAPTER I.

THE FAIRY'S ORIGIN.

"Die Eifersucht ist eine Leidenschaft der mit Eifer sucht muss Leiden
schaffen."--_German Proverb._


Very many years ago, in a valley a few miles from the coast, there stood
a French chÄËteau, beautifully situated in a handsome park near the
Norman village of Carolles. The rich woodland scenery, the green
pastures with their large wild fences now laden with wild roses; the
shady lanes, whose banks will soon be covered with the long, bright
green fronds of the hartstongue, and the delicate drooping trichomanes;
the fine timber, and the picturesque farmhouses with their thatched
roofs nestling in the valleys--all tend to give a home-like English air
to the scenery of Normandy. And the district in which the ChÄËteau de
Thorens stands possesses all these attractions for an English eye. Not
that any English people lived in the chÄËteau; the De Thorens were
French, or rather Norman, to the backbone, descended from the great
duke, and proud as Lucifer of their birth. Pride and poverty are
generally supposed to go together; and though poor is perhaps hardly the
word to apply to people who could afford to live in the ease and luxury
which prevailed at ChÄËteau de Thorens, yet for their rank the De Thorens
were not rich, and, consequently, after the fashion of many French
families, there were three generations of them now all living under the
ancestral roof.

First there was the old baroness, a picturesque old lady with very white
hair and piercing black eyes, with whom we have very little to do; then
there was her eldest son, the present baron, for his father had been
dead some years, and his beautiful young wife, whom he was so
passionately fond of that he was jealous--dreadfully jealous--of her
love for her baby, a little girl a few months old; and, lastly, there
were the baron's three younger brothers, who with PÄÂ¨re Yvon, the
chaplain, made up the family party. The two younger brothers were mere
boys, still under PÄÂ¨re Yvon's charge, for he acted as tutor to them as
well as chaplain; but LÄĹ on de Thorens was a young man of
five-and-twenty, only a year or two younger than the baron. He was a
fine, handsome man, tall and thin, with his mother's fine black eyes and
small well-cut nose and mouth. He was of a bold, reckless nature, full
of animal spirits, the very life of the house when he was at home, which
was seldom, as he owned a yacht, in which he spent a great deal of his
time. He was his mother's favourite son, and both he and she had often
privately regretted that he was not the eldest.

The baron was smaller and fairer than LÄĹ on, and not so handsome, though
there was a strong family likeness between the brothers. He was of a
quieter disposition, and his restlessness took an intellectual rather
than a physical form, his wanderings being confined to the shelves of
the valuable library which the chÄËteau boasted, instead of extending
over the seas on which LÄĹ on spent so much of his time. The baron's
studious nature had endeared him very much to PÄÂ¨re Yvon, with whom he
was a prime favourite, and who had never shown him any of the severity
of which the other brothers often complained, but, on the contrary, had
erred on the opposite side with the baron, whose wishes had never been
crossed in any way, and who had grown up to think himself the one
important person in the world to whom the convenience of everyone else
must be sacrificed.

For the first year of their married life the pretty baroness had
contributed as much as PÄÂ¨re Yvon to spoil her husband, whose every whim
she had humoured until her baby was born, and then, much to his
astonishment, the baron found that his beautiful, gentle wife had a will
of her own, and, what was still worse in his eyes, a large place in her
heart for someone else besides himself, and although that someone else
was only his infant daughter, the baron was jealous.

In vain had he urged that the baby should be sent away to some peasant
to nurse until it was a year or two old, as he and all his brothers had
been, after a very common custom in French families. No, the baroness
would not hear of such a thing; she could not live without her baby, and
every moment she could spare she spent by its cradle. Indeed, so
infatuated was she with her new possession, whose every movement was a
delight to her, that she did not notice the baron became daily more and
more morose, and that an ominous frown had settled on his fine forehead,
while his mouth was closed with a determination that boded ill for his
wife and daughter. But the baroness lived so much in her child that she
did not observe the change in her husband; and as he never allowed the
baby to be brought into his presence, the baroness saw but little of him
except at meals, when all the others were present, and LÄĹ on's wild
spirits covered his brother's depression and silence.

At last, one fine June morning, matters reached a climax, when the
family sat down to their one o'clock _dÄĹ jeuner_. The baroness was late;
the first course was finished, and still she did not appear.

"Where is Mathilde, Arnaut?" asked the old baroness.

"I don't know," said the baron, sulkily.

"I do," said LÄĹ on; "she is worshipping at the shrine of that precious
baby of yours, Arnaut. Why on earth don't you send it away till it is
old enough to amuse us?"

"Go and tell Madame la Baronne the soup is already finished," said the
baron to a servant at his elbow; but he vouchsafed no further answer.

"I think Arnaut has suggested that the baby should be sent away, but
Mathilde objects," remarked the old baroness.

"Send it away without asking her, then. Give her a pug instead; it will
be much more amusing, and not half the trouble the baby is," said LÄĹ on.

Here the servant returned to say madame would take her _dÄĹ jeuner_ in the
nursery, as the nurse was out and she could not leave the baby.

"Really, Mathilde is too absurd, when there are at least three or four
other servants in the house who could look after the baby as well as the
nurse," said the old baroness, helping herself to some omelette.

"She is mad," muttered the baron, angrily.

"Quite, all women are; there can be no doubt about that. Look here,
Arnaut, it is quite clear if you don't send that infant away, you might
just as well live _en garÄÂ§on_, like me, as I foresee you won't have much
of Mathilde's society now," said LÄĹ on.

"It does not require much foresight to predict that," said the baron,
bitterly.

"Well, if Mathilde won't send it away, just hand it over to me the next
time I take a cruise, which will be as soon as ever there is wind enough
to fill my sails, and I'll place the child somewhere where there is no
fear of Mathilde getting it again till it is of a reasonable age," said
LÄĹ on.

The idea of handing the baby over to the tender mercies of LÄĹ on struck
them all as so comic that a general laugh, in which all but the baron
joined, greeted this speech, which was forgotten as soon as it was
uttered by the speaker.

A few days after LÄĹ on announced that he was going on board his yacht
that evening; a south wind was blowing, and he should take a cruise up
the Channel. Would the baron go with him? They were sure to have fine
weather, and it would be delightful at sea in this heat. The baron
declined the invitation, as he was a wretched sailor; but that evening,
when he and LÄĹ on were smoking after dinner, he said, suddenly, "Where
are you going, LÄĹ on?"

"I don't know; it depends on the wind. I may run over to England, or I
may only go to the Channel Isles. I shall see."

"Shall you touch anywhere?"

"Oh, yes, I shall go ashore; I shan't take provisions for more than a
week. Why?"

The baron looked round the verandah in which they were sitting to make
sure that they were alone, and having satisfied himself of this he leant
forward and said, in a half-whisper, "Tiens, LÄĹ on! Will you help me? I
am determined to stand it no longer; it is wearing my life out; I have
not a moment's peace. If I don't get rid of it I believe I shall go
mad."

"What is it you are talking of? I'll help you if I can, but what is
wearing your life out?" said LÄĹ on.

[Illustration: THE BARONESS.]

"The baby, of course," said the baron.

"The baby! Well, but what do you want me to do with that! I can't kill
it, you know."

"Of course not, but you said in joke the other day you would take it
with you on one of your trips, and put it out to nurse. I wish to
heaven, LÄĹ on, you'd do it in reality. It is no use my sending it to
anyone near here; Mathilde would go after it the next day. My only
chance is to send it somewhere where it will be safe, of course, and
well looked after, but where Mathilde can't go after it, and as she
would go to the end of the world for it if she knew where it was, it
must go where she can't find it; she must not know where it is. No one,
indeed, need know but you, for as far as I am concerned the less I know
about it at present the better; it has spoilt all my happiness. Mathilde
is so wrapped up in that child she does not care a fig for me now; in
fact, I rarely see her. If you can only put that infant safely out of
our way for a year or two, I'll never forget it, LÄĹ on."

"Are you in real sober earnest, Arnaut?" asked LÄĹ on, who, in his
astonishment, had risen to his feet, and was puffing away vigorously at
his cigar.

"Of course I am. I am willing to pay handsomely for it, and I shall
depend upon you putting it where it will be well taken care of. As for
all the rest, I leave it to you to take it where you like--Australia if
you wish, only don't tell me where it is, or I might cut my own throat
by telling Mathilde if she makes a great scene, as she will when it is
gone. Will you do it, LÄĹ on?"

"Whew!" whistled LÄĹ on. "I don't care for the work, for if anything
should happen to the child Mathilde would never forgive me nor you
either. However, if you insist, I think I could manage it, but as I am
going to start in two or three hours, there is not much time. I must go
down to the yacht and speak to my men first. If I may tell them I am
taking the child by your express wish I could manage it, I think. The
next difficulty is where to take it, but I have an idea about that, so
I'll be off now, and see what I can arrange. I shall ride, so I shall be
back in an hour."

"Tell them anything you like, except not to let anyone know where you
leave the child," replied the baron, as LÄĹ on started on an errand which,
in spite of his protest to the contrary, was thoroughly after his own
heart; indeed, any mad freak such as this was quite in his line.

Among his crew he had an English sailor who acted as carpenter, and, as
LÄĹ on often said, was worth two or three French sailors in a gale or an
emergency. He knew the Channel, too, as well as a pilot, and, indeed
often acted in that capacity; he was an honest, trustworthy man--at
least, so LÄĹ on thought; and as he rode over the hills to Carolles, he
decided to take this man into his confidence, and see if he could help
him; it was possible this Englishman knew of some of his own
countrywomen who would undertake the charge of the child.

Accordingly, when he reached his yacht, LÄĹ on called for John Smith, and
had a long conversation with him in English, which he spoke fairly well,
the result of which was the carpenter, after a little thought, declared
he knew of a shepherd and his wife in Sussex who, he felt sure, would
undertake the charge of the child; his only fear was that they might
have some scruples about keeping the matter a secret, and might want to
know who the child was; but if LÄĹ on would leave this to him to arrange,
he could, he thought, manage it so that the shepherd should have no idea
to whom the child belonged, nor why it was put into his care.

"Where does this good man live?" asked LÄĹ on.

"About four or five miles from Brighton, sir. The wind is favourable; we
might run across in twenty-four hours or less if it lasts, and I think
it will; we shall have the tide with us going out if we start at ten
to-night," said the carpenter.

"Well, that is settled. Now the next point is, who is to take care of it
on board? It must be fed; who of our men understands babies best?"

"I can't undertake that, sir, but there's Pierre Legros, he has half a
dozen of his own, and when he is at home looks after them all I believe;
he ought to know all about it."

"Call Pierre, then."

Pierre Legros was accordingly called, and, on hearing what was required
of him, professed with pride his ability to act as nurse during the
voyage; and having commissioned him to lay in a stock of food for the
baby, about which LÄĹ on's ideas were exceedingly vague, LÄĹ on rode back to
the chÄËteau.

The baron was on the lookout for him, and was delighted to hear all was
arranged for the baby's removal.

"I have not been idle since you have been gone. Luckily Mathilde has a
headache, so I have sent her to bed, and I sat with her till she was
asleep. My next care was to get rid of the nurse, so I have packed her
off to BrÄĹ cy with one of the other servants for some medicine for
Mathilde, and the coast is clear to the nursery now. There is only one
of the housemaids with the baby, and when you are ready to start you
must lose something and require her to find it while I secure the child.
Lastly, I ordered the dogcart, and said I would drive you."

"But how about the child?" interrupted LÄĹ on.

"I am coming to that. Just as we are going to start, you must lose a
stick or a coat. I'll offer to go back for it, and meet you at the side
door; there is a staircase leading to the nursery close to it, down
which I shall come with the baby after I have sent the housemaid who is
guarding it to look for your stick. We shall be off and the baby on
board before it is missed, for the girl is sure to stay gossiping with
the other servants when we are off."

"Well, I hope you'll succeed, but I confess I think this is the most
difficult part of the affair. However, there is no time to lose; you had
better order the dogcart at once, while I go and say good-bye to mother
and the boys. We must be off in twenty minutes," replied LÄĹ on.

Half an hour later the brothers were seated in the dogcart, while the
old baroness, with a shawl thrown round her head, stood on the steps
under the portico to catch the last glimpse of her handsome LÄĹ on, with
her two younger boys by her side, and PÄÂ¨re Yvon and some of the servants
in the background. The groom had just let go of the horse's bridle when
LÄĹ on exclaimed--

"Wait a minute! I have forgotten my Malacca cane. I lent it to you the
other day, Arnaut. I must have it. Where shall I find it?"

"So you did. Here, one of you boys, run into my--but no, you'll wake
Mathilde, I'll go myself. Here, LÄĹ on, take the reins, and drive round to
the side door; I'll meet you there," said the baron, descending from the
dogcart, and running into the house.
