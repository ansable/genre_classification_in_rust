<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Jammie Hamscott! You will not leave this house!Jammie!-" Screaming filled my ears, fire surrounded me. My mother and father appeared again in front of me burning. </p><p>"Jammie, how dare you, this is your fault we're like this! You started the fire! you did it on purpose! It should have been you!"<br/> <br/> <em>"SHUT UP!"</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em>Jammie's POV</em> </strong>

  <strong>Beep. </strong>

  <strong>BE-</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>"Ugh..." </p><p>Hi. I'm Jammie Hamscott. I moved to a place Called Derry when I was 19 to get away from some ghost past that keeps haunting me....</p><p><em>But did that work? I guess no- </em>Shut it brain, Are you telling my story? no. stay quiet. </p><p>Anyway, My parents died in a Accidental fire, which I still blame myself for to this day. But now, I'm 21, and life was getting just fine till my dream....</p><p>"Jammie! hey wait up!" Jalyn Boyce, my one and possibly only best friend here in derry."Jammie, where are you going?" He ran up to  me with a worried look on his face, but he was smiling with that one smile I am so warmed up by every time I see it."Nowhere.. I just need to get some fresh air to get my mind off... things."I knew he knew why, he always found a way to read me like a book.He looked at me for a while before saying something. "was it about...the fire again?"</p><p> <em>Bingo! almost hundredth point for jalyn and zero for jammie, wow, he really did read you like a book jammi- </em>AGAIN,SHUT IT!.... </p><p>"Yeah..." I looked away trying to push that away from me, but I just couldn't." But I'm sure it'll go away soon.." He looked like he had regretted saying anything, his hand at the back of his head." Yeah, it will.... and news for last week, Another kid went missing, his name was Michael Dest. no one found him yet, but it's like they didn't even remember he went missing. I think you should go in early today, just to be safe..." The only thing that ran through my head was, I knew that kid. he was a foster at a home next to mine.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                       *******************                                                                                 </p><p>Jalyn ended up walking with me home, then he left me to go home himself. I've dealt with very bad Paranoia wince I was in the first grade. I was always Paranoid when I was alone so I always checked my windows to see if anyone was watching me. which, no one was, but I still had the feeling that I was being watched. "No one... is watching me.." I shook a little still feeling inhuman eyes staring in the back of my skull, it was weird. I headed to my room, and stripped myself of my clothing, leaving me in my Bra and panties. I sat on my bed and leaned up against the headboard of the bed, trying to get myself comfortable before stripping myself from the last two things hiding everything else. Trying to get my mind off of my paranoia, I let my hands wander down to my lower region and my finger toyed with my most sensitive spot. "a-ah!" I let out a squeak before inserting a finger into my now slightly moist core. I moved a little more to get myself comfortable again and started to pump my finger. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>Pennywise's POV</strong> </em>
</p><p>"Ugh. Disgusting..." filthy humans doing what they need to <em>'Please'</em> themselves and create more of those treacherous little children, that taste so amazing when they are afraid. that smell was everywhere, and even in the sewers, but there's this one smell.. it's unknown by who, like they've never been here. the smell I was smelling was <strong>Sweet </strong>like chocolate covered Strawberries. I ended up finding myself following the smell to a little house, very dull color, just a few houses away from Nebolt. I looked around finding all windows were covered by black sheets, but one. </p><p>"h-mmm~" my eyes widened.I was a bit shocked by what I saw but then I also smelt fear coming from her.it was slowly disappearing and turning into the Sweet smell I followed. Her noises sounded like pethetic little whines every little child I have eaten made when they witnessed me. I couldn't stop staring at her beautiful pale brown skin, covered in sweat and her hand in between her legs, pumping in and out of her. I witnessed where the smell was coming from before but, there was two humans involved,not just one.  Her eyes were closed so she couldn't see me. I had no idea that there was drool coming out of my mouth. Her back was arched just a little as her pumping fastened and her little whines turned into moans, something about this human made me feel...aroused is what humans would say but I felt like a switch was flipped and the only way of turning it off was with her. </p><p>I thought toying with her would make this better so I used my telekinesis to make it harder for her to release.That only lasted a couple of seconds till my stomach told me it was time to feed.</p><p>"Next time sweet chocolate drop, next time"Then off I was. still 'turned on' by that, but that would be dealt with later.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
