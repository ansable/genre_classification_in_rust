This Rust crate naively implements a simple Naive Bayes genre classifier. A more detailed system description can be found in the file *description.pdf*

**The side note:** this is a work in progress awaiting for additionts and improvements. As an example of possible improvement you probably will find a cold half unfinished attempt to do SVD, which one day will be definitely finished.

**And the second important side note:** Corpora which we used for our analysis was manually collected from the Project Gutenberg website (to which we are extremely grateful) and a fanfiction website https://archiveofourown.org/ (endless love to it too).
