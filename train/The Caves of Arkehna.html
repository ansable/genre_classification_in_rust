    <p>Summary</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>New high-schooler Avery Marlow spends most of her time exploring the caverns near her Adirondack cabin. Lost in her social life, she feels quite content in her heavily explored forests and mountains. However, she becomes the lost she’s ever been not because she ends up falling into an unmapped crevasse: Her savior happens to be a curious-looking teenager who, along with about 300 others, has been secretly living within the mountains' caves for more than three centuries.</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Avery’s bike swayed from side to side as she pedaled into the earth wet from yesterday’s rainfall. The logs of her cabin home peeked between the pine, but after biking up this hill many a time, she knew it’d take several more minutes of heart-pounding biking before she could finally relax from today’s first day of school.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she passed her favorite boulder left behind by glaciers millions of years ago, she turned her handlebars too quickly and slipped, tripping on soggy leaves. Her helmet cushioned the blow, but her legs, too long for her age, tangled between the bike pegs. Trapped, she felt her heartbeat beat against her temple, watching the sky glide above her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her two dogs, Oreo and Pumpkin, exploded with barks at the sound of the accident. They were sheltered inside the garage, tied around the support beam so they didn’t get loose. They had enough leash-length to sniff the edges of the unending forest. Their respective black and orange ears jumped behind the bushes outlining the property, eager to see their owner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery dusted off her clothes as she eyed the windows to her three-story home. Her parents had chosen this house to feel more “rustic,” but it didn’t fit the picture at all: tall windows, decorated porches, and empty balconies. It only impressed their neighbors of squirrels and robins.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery waited for her parents to come outside to the commotion, maybe to see if she needed help.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nobody came.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She parked her bike, nuzzled her huskies, and went inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother and father were studying in their study/dining room. Sprawled out between papers, filing cabinets, and laptops, the two occupied their house with work. They had bought the extendable table for dinner parties and family reunions. In the thirteen years Avery had lived here, the only family she’d ever met were her mother’s parents, who, if you drove five minutes down the hill, were their closest neighbors. They owned a small country store on the main road.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Avery closed the door to the garage, her father looked up. His glasses slipped down to his long nose. “How was your first Friday of school?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Avery said, but it wasn’t. Sidestepping around her two hungry dogs, she pulled out their food dishes from the cabinets and divided their food can into two mushy piles. While Pumpkin jumped and scratched the granite counter, Oreo waited patiently by Avery’s side. He’d gotten used to Avery feeding him, but Pumpkin had yet to become acquainted. She still thought Avery’s mother and father would find the time to feed them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After feeding her two dogs and cleaning out her lunch bag, Avery gave the dining room a quick nod—it looked like her mother nodded back—and climbed up the stairs on her hands and knees to her loft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had the loft to herself, complete with a small bath and fireplace. Pictures of her younger years hung above the railing and mantle. She’d done a purge of friendly photos when she started middle school. They sat next to her fireplace, ready to be burned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The railing overlooked their wide foyer and the front windows. Here, Avery bared witness to the start of the Adirondack Mountains. Whenever she had a troubling day—like today, like every day—she outlined what she saw of the blurry mountaintops and waited for geese to fly up to Canada.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But backpacking deep into its woods proved to be better therapy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After her dogs gobbled up their food, Pumpkin bolted for the staircase and pawed the first step, waiting with her tail wagging.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery checked the Sun’s position in the sky. She had at least two hours of daylight left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She acted fast. Snatching her hiking backpack from underneath her bed, she equipped it with two water bottles, a flashlight, extra batteries, and a pocket knife. She switched out her tennis shoes for a pair of Timberlands and changed into a longer sweater. She also nabbed her walkie-talkie from her mirror wardrobe. Her mother insisted that she carry one in case Avery’s phone ever lost signal and she found herself trapped inside a dark crevasse. It’d only happened once, but once was enough for her mother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After checking herself in the mirror and grimacing at what she saw, Avery pulled her beanie over her eyebrows and climbed back down to the first floor. Pumpkin yipped when she saw Avery’s new attire, and Oreo, still finishing up his meal, wagged his tail at the opportunity for a hike.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’re you going?” her father asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just going out,” Avery said. “I’ll be back before it gets dark.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You just got home,” Avery’s mother said, finally putting down her work. “Where’re you going?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just my usual path,” she said, already heading for the patio door. “I’ll be fine. I’m taking the dogs, too, if that’s okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother went for her cane to stand up. “Do you have—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cutting her off, Avery dangled her walkie-talkie from the strap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother sat back down in a sigh. She pulled her pocketbook to her lap and made sure that she, too, had her walkie-talkie at the ready. She clicked it on, heard its familiar static, then put it beside her phone buzzing with work emails. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have fun,” her father said, “and watch out for ticks. Check yourself if you walk into any tall grass.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No tall grass at </span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” her mother added. “You’re immediately taking a shower when you come home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery almost closed the double doors on Oreo’s black and white tail.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maneuvering around patio furniture, Avery finally escaped for the forest. Pavement morphed into earth. Fallen leaves became her path. The scent of airy freedom welcomed her to her second home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’d lived her whole life here, in upstate New York. Her parents had moved upwards from Manhattan to be closer to Avery’s grandparents. This was back when Avery still slept in her mother’s belly and when her mother didn’t need a cane to walk. As her parents worked odd hours, taking long business calls outside on the balconies, Avery had spent her time climbing boulders and creating her own trails to lose herself on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Who needed friends when the Earth welcomed everyone and anything into it? They—the trees, the streams, the caves—didn’t care about how you looked, they cared if you left only footprints. They didn’t make fun of you for wearing the same top more than once. They didn’t question the type of person you’d become. They weren’t jerks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Twenty minutes into her walk and Avery’s feelings about school, about Bridget, faded. Walking with Oreo and Pumpkin and discovering newly formed vernal ponds, </span>
  <em>
    <span>they </span>
  </em>
  <span>would make her new teenage years adventurous. She’d live easy like this, free of friends who didn’t care about your feelings when they knew darn well how much they meant to you.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deep into their walk, they finally came to Avery’s favorite parts of the mountain range: the caves. Some of the cooler, deeper caves had tourist traps bitten into them, but some of smaller caves were free to the public. They didn’t have fancy waterfalls or crystals in them, and they didn’t have railings to keep you from falling, but Avery didn’t mind; she’d gotten trapped between two large rocks when she was twelve, not thirteen. Not that the one-year difference meant a whole lot, but Avery had a lot of free time to learn better since her only friend decided that her company wasn’t worth it anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something magical emanated from these small caves, though, especially when a sudden rain caught her by surprise. She’d hunker down in their entrances, watching the ground darken, discovering hidden smells birthed by the gentle patter of rain off the ancient rocks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cave’s temperature, like walking into a freezer, cooled instantly as Avery entered. Oreo sniffed the small grass curling around the edges as Pumpkin, hesitant, turned her orange ears to the end of the cave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve been here before,” Avery reminded them. “It’s okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The couple refused. Oreo planted his butt at the entrance while Pumpkin started licking the walls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no.” She pulled Pumpkin back and sat her next to her other half. “Stay here, then. Don’t move.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery never found a justification for her fascination with caves, with spelunking, but she guessed most people didn’t. They simply crawled into the tight spaces just to say they’d done it. The quiet unfamiliarity of the echoes announced your presence to no one, yet you always felt like you were invading someone’s home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery sat down on a dry spot and rolled her head back and forth on the cave’s grimy wall. She checked the insides of her socks and boots for any ticks, then took off her beanie to ruffle out her long, black hair. She studied her beanie’s pins she’d collected from middle school, like the time she and Bridget had gone to a maple syrup festival and when they survived through their favorite comic book convention. She rubbed over the nicks in the oldest one. She’d traded it with Bridget because she wanted the prettier one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Putting back on her hat, Avery hid her eyes with it, stretching it down to her chin so she didn’t see anything. She didn’t need Bridget anymore. She’d find a new best friend in a new class. Who cared if Bridget was in almost every class of Avery’s? She didn’t care for Avery anymore, so neither would she.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery’s stomach growled. Moaning, she pulled off her backpack and went for one of her stashed energy bars.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rock she’d been sitting against, once stable and firm, suddenly gave out from behind her, dropping her like a phantom step. This drop, however, didn’t have a railing for her to grab hold to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She reached blindly for the crumbling wall only to break off a piece of limestone. She kicked out her legs to catch on something, but the ground slipped out from underneath her, and her backpack became her anchor, plummeting her into darkness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tumbled backwards down a decline and crushed her head on something hard. Her backpack ripped and broke away from her. Her body got pummeled by invisible stalagmites, sturdy enough not to break, unyielding enough to knock the wind out of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The earth felt colder here, damper with more of a mildew smell than a cave one. She didn’t know a cave existed here. She didn’t think anything existed beyond these encasing walls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she finally stopped falling, Avery choked on a cry. The soreness rushed her in waves, reminding her about every nerve and muscle she owned. When the spinning feeling waned, she opened her watering eyes to blackness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fearing she’d gone blind from hitting her head, Avery flipped open her phone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t help. The space she’d fallen into had walls so cramped they almost touched. She couldn’t stretch out her legs. She couldn’t breathe. She looked up to see where she’d fallen from and saw no light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Panic swelled. She couldn’t die here. Even if she somehow survived, her parents would never let her out of the house again. She’d get homeschooled, rumors would spread, Bridget would call her names again…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery shined her light up and down the incline, hoping to find another way out. She spotted her backpack ten feet above her, snagged on a log. Prehistoric pieces of wood were embedded into the wall. They looked like a makeshift ladder leading towards the surface. Small bug hopped from step to step. In Avery’s peripheral vision, they appeared to glow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something creeped up behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery yelped and shined her phone at them like a weapon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The person yelped back and shielded their eyes. They looked like a boy about her age, but smaller, very small. He carried with him a backpack with a lantern hooked to it by a stick, like a traveller. On his paper-thin, paper-colored skin, Avery saw grooves etched into his inner right forearm. It looked like a map carved from skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Avery lowered her light, the boy squinted at her. His left eye was pale and discolored due to a scar that dug through his forehead down through his nose.</span>
</p><p>

  <span>“I need help,” Avery told him. “I-I fell. I’m hurt. I don’t know where I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy responded back with his own question in his own language. Everything from his words to his face to his primitive clothing seemed otherworldly. When he didn’t get the answer he wanted, he balanced himself on his knees and knuckles like a gorilla and sniffed her. Whatever he got from her scent, he shook his head, placed his dirty fingers in his mouth, and whistled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A furry bat fluttered through the tunnel and landed on the boy’s arm. The boy said a few words to it, kissed its lips—it let him—then pulled out a colored rock and placed it in its mouth. After another kiss, he cast the bat back into the tunnel: a secret mission shared between only them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then the boy looked back at Avery, waiting for an explanation he’d never understand.</span>

  <p>Cameron stood stunned in the Main Exit tunnle, staring in terror at the Autrean girl. They should’ve never come here. They’d tried reading their fortune before excavating this tunnle. Their gemmes hadn’t warned them that they’d run into trouble, much less an Autrean.</p><p>Said Autrean continued staring up at them, shining that awful light. She’d finally placed it down like Cameron had begged her to do, but the light bouncing off the rock hurt too much. Cameron had brought with them a glass lantern filled with firebugs, which gave off the most necessary light to see, but this almost blinded them.</p><p>They tried asking again, “Can you stand? Can you move?” but like they guessed, she didn’t understand them. She shivered as she sat up, then hissed and pulled out pieces of rock from her hand. Blood scrapped her dark palms.</p><p>So dark, this girl. They knew Autreans as dark, like Basil, but this girl had skin and hair as black as a cave. Even though it hurt to do so, Cameron couldn’t look away from her for very long.</p><p>They had to, though. Cleaning off their hands on their poncho, Cameron squatted down beside the girl. Knowing she couldn’t speak Arkęh:nen, Cameron tried making themselves look presentable and friendly. They even waved; they heard from scavengers like Basil that that’s how Autreans showed each other kindness.</p><p>The girl spoke. Cameron shook their head, totally lost. Very little of her words mirrored theirs, and Cameron couldn’t just bring her back to the surface. Their job since childhood was and would forever be an excavator, a simple folk who gathered gemmes for the psychics to use in their practices. They hadn’t the strength to be a scavenger, they couldn’t brave the outside world alone.</p><p>Soon enough, with gentle words that went nowhere, Cameron brought the girl to her feet. Standing at her full height, she’d definitely become the tallest person Cameron had ever met, but they knew Autreans grew like trees on the surface. Something to do with all that sunlight.</p><p>Cameron turned to leave, but the girl didn’t follow. Being patient, Cameron reached for her hand.</p><p>She went to turn on her strange light.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Her device blinded them yet again, and Cameron dropped to their knees and shielded their sensitive eyes. They’d already broken most of their left eye due to their first tunnle collapse when they were twelve. They couldn’t risk losing the rest of their sight. If an Arkęh:nen lost their sight, they lost their ability to be helpful to the Community, a fate worse than a tunnle collapse.</p><p>When the girl saw how light affected Cameron’s vision, she pocketed her device. She said something that sounded apologetic.</p><p>Taking her hand again, Cameron led her towards home somewhat blind.</p><p>Not that they needed sight to see. Cameron could’ve easily found their way back home with their hands bound and their ears muffled. They’d spent days in these tunnles at a time. The kaart etched onto their right arm had become obsolete as a navigating map. Now they only looked at it whenever they excavated a new tunnle. Then they’d take a knife and etch a new line down their fragile skin.</p><p>The Autrean girl, however, had difficulties. She’d hurt her leg and needed to palm the tunnle walls for guidance. Occasionally she’d smack into the low-hanging rocks. Cameron warned her whenever an upcoming one might hit her and even maneuvered her out of the way, but she somehow hit each and every one.</p><p>When Cameron reached the end of the tunnle, they carefully led the girl up the steps and pulled back the curtains to Arkęh:na.</p><p>Since Cameron had left to hunt for new gemmes, more of the ville—their shopping district—had opened. It must’ve been getting close to 5PM. Cameron had woken up earlier than usual—4:30PM—to avoid being hounded down for not being where they were supposed to be.</p><p>Beyond the ville were the stairs and ladders leading down into the underground layers of Arkęh:na. Cutting through it lived the Rivière, a long but narrow river that split the ville in half, and the Centrum, the main meeting place centered in Arkęh:na. To the right side of the Rivière was the washing pond and its waterfalls, the psychics’ underground reading space, and the artisans’ shoppes. There the seamstresses, pottery makers, cooks, and farm owners worked to keep Arkęh:na functional. A few early birds had started the day right, calling out orders to workers in the mud huts. Cameron didn’t see Basil or Maywood, which surprised them. Maywood usually kept Basil from running away from his job.</p><p>Cameron went to trot over the tiny bridge across the Rivière, but they’d lost the girl’s hand. She faltered at the Main Exit Tunnle with a dropped jaw. She took in everything, from the Centrum’s tall pillars adorned by lanterns to the ville opening up for the morning. The more she saw in the faded light, the wider her jaw opened.</p><p>When she started rubbing her arms up and down, Cameron led her to the seamstress’ huts to cool off. They avoided looking down at the psychics’ dens as they crossed the bridge. Their energy radiated through the wood into Cameron’s moccasins.</p><p>Cameron never spent too much time on this side of their Rivière. Their lack of skills had no place with so many artisans. Cameron had been gifted with the rare sense to locate and extract gemmes, but nobody cared. Cameron’s Moeder was a psychic, and a prestigious one at that. Everyone revered her for her fortune-telling skills, and when Cameron had been created, the Community had expected the same talent from them.</p><p>They’d become an excavator instead, one who caused frequent cave-ins and zapped all the energy from a gemme the moment they touched it.</p><p>Inside the mud huts, the seamstresses worked hard at their spinning wheels, threading clothes for Arkęh:na. Their silkworms buzzed with life as their balls of thread were fished from their cages. Cameron owned two outfits, both of which had been made here by caring, calloused hands.</p><p>Maywood, sitting on her usual stool, looked up to greet Cameron. Then she noticed the dark-skinned Autrean girl behind them.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Cameron said. Before she sat up and used most of her strength for the day, Cameron leaned down and kissed her cheek. She was Basil’s older sister, the more dependable child of their family.</p><p>“I found her at the Main Exit,” Cameron explained. “She somehow fell down and injured herself. I think she’s hurt, but I can’t understand her.”</p><p>To demonstrate for them, the Autrean said something in an exasperated tone. She started wandering around the kilns and pottery left out to dry. She went to touch an unfinished bowl, then thought better of herself and pulled back to admire the craft without touching it. Had she never seen a kiln before?</p><p>“You shouldn’t have brought her down here,” Maywood warned. “They’re not allowed here. You know that.”</p><p>“I know, but she’s hurt. I was wondering if you could help patch up her clothes, then I was going to find her a healer.”</p><p>A few of the artisans pulled back from their work and whispered about the Autrean girl. Cameron’s face burned in embarrassment not for bringing her into the Community, but from being talked about. Their Moeder had told Cameron not to worry about how people thought of them, but that was impossible. They wanted to do good by everyone, Arkęh:nen and Autrean alike.</p><p>Maywood scratched her thinning hairline. “When’s the last time an Autrean came here? I can’t remember.”</p><p>Cameron shrugged. They’d never seen one personally, but they’d heard the rumors. Back in the olden days, Arkęh:nen women would leave to have children with Autrean men. They still did it sometimes. Basil had been one of those children, a child born from dirt and Sun.</p><p>“This’s serious, Cameron,” Maywood said. “Should we tell the Grandmoeders about this?”</p><p>“No,” Cameron said promptly. “I can’t worry them with something so trivial. She just needs help. Are there any healers awake yet?”</p><p>Maywood went to answer, then caught sight of someone outside. “Oh, dear.”</p><p>Basil stood in the doorway of the mud hut, panting. Balls of silk clung to his bear-skin dress. It looked like he’d been trying to transfer the cocoons to the boilers for processing, but had accidentally fallen into a nest. He ripped off the sticky cocoons as he gawked at the Autrean. “What the hell is an Autrean doing here?”</p><p>It sounded like he asked the same question to the Autrean in her native tongue. Basil knew how to speak basic Autrean, but the girl still didn’t answer.</p><p>Arkęh:nen from across the Rivière sought out the source of Basil’s anger. More gossip and thoughts surfaced. They pointed, whispered.</p><p>Basil walked around the Autrean like she’d bite him, then pulled on Maywood’s shirt. “What’s she doing here?” he asked. “Did you do this?”</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/569f2acc324b30ac56b5c38942458410/tumblr_pb5mucTPG81qmqh98o1_1280.png" alt="" width="640" height="396" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1832606847" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
</p><p>“I brought her in,” Cameron said.</p><p>“Why?” Basil asked. “Cameron, I’ve told you, they’re dangerous. Were you at the exit tunnles again?”</p><p>“Lower your voice,” Maywood told him. “It’s too early.”</p><p>“I found her at the Main Exit,” Cameron explained. “She’s hurt.”</p><p>“The Main—That’s the closest one to the Autreans! She needs to go back. I’m taking her back.”</p><p>“She’s hurt,” Cameron insisted. “We have to help her.”</p><p>“She’s <em> Autrean </em>.”</p><p>“And we’re <em> Arkęh:nen </em>, and Arkęh:nen help anyone who needs it.”</p><p>Basil bit his cheek, battling Cameron on a truth they’d been taught as children. Just because he was half-Autrean didn’t give him the right to speak down upon them, and it didn’t negate their duties to protect anyone who needed protection.</p><p>The Autrean girl backed away. She kept shaking her head and repeating a phrase over and over again. Then the build-up from the fall, from Arkęh:na, and from not being acknowledged burst from her throat. She screamed and hollered and said everything trapped inside her. She pointed at Cameron, then at Maywood, then she took it upon herself to explore Arkęh:na by herself. Tripping over the bridge, she pushed through the gathering crowd and ran.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>She must’ve fallen into an elaborate cosplaying festival, or a medieval reenactment. It was the only explanation for such a place existing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With her leg twinging in pain, Avery ran for the tunnel she and the cave boy had just come through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Strangers had collected around the entrance. Their clothes looked and smelled just like the clothes those three teenagers wore. They held knives, rolls of rope, and those lanterns filled with fireflies. They, like everyone else, whispered behind their hands about her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery scrambled backwards and ran back down the length of the river. She just had to follow its current to find her way back home. When the boy had led her down here, she’d tried calling her parents to save her, but the calls hadn’t gone through. Inside these caves, she had no contact with the outside world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vendors from the line of shops came out and asked her questions she couldn’t understand. One even grabbed her arm and pointed at her knee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know!” she yelled, and barrelled through the crowd forming around her. There must’ve been another person in this cave system that spoke English. That boy covered in bugs had spoken English to her.</span>
  <em>
    <span> “Why the hell you here?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’d said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hoped she’d never have to speak to him again. She hadn’t said a word to him, yet he’d already found a reason to hate her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She headed for what she believed to be north towards the only other exit she saw. Next to the lantern-illuminated exit was a two-story rock building that grazed the top of the hollowed-out city. Children played in and outside the structure, tossing balls to one another and drawing in the dirt. They all wore the same garb: long, brown dresses with black pockets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before they prodded her with more questions, Avery ducked into the tunnel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Darkness encased her like a coffin. She reached in front of her and found that the tunnel split in two, left and right, each direction just as dark as the other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy with the injured eye hobbled towards Avery. He and the bug-covered boy held out their hands to stop her. Realizing a chase had commenced, some of the adults watching over the children dropped their work to see if Avery would get caught.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery sucked in the cave air and chose to go right. She kept one hand on the wall and one in front of her. She stayed close to the tunnel’s curves, choosing different ways at random, before finally finding a pinpoint of light. Faint, but Avery ran towards it regardless, her only point of reference.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A wooden door covered by moss blocked her path. Fireflies buzzed around the lanterns lit not by bugs but by rocks. Tiny gemstones shined a blue light, humming gently with energy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery checked around it. Like she guessed, no outlets, not power cords.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two boys ran down the tunnel. The boy with the scarred face wheezed and coughed from running so hard, the angry one looked ready to punch her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t go in there!” he warned in English. “Not allowed!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Casting the boy’s warning aside, Avery wrestled with the wooden door and thrust it open. The scarred boy fell back on his butt and shielded his eyes with both of his thin arms. The angry boy cursed and turned away just as Avery tried shutting the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The air significantly cooled, so much so that Avery questioned why she couldn’t see her breath. As the heavy door shut on its own, Avery accidentally trapped herself in a wide room filled and embedded with magnificent crystals.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The gemstones glowed in puddles, or the puddles had something bioluminescent in them that made them glow. They jutted out from the walls in stunning sizes and fragments. They lit a trail into the room, growing high on the ceilings and pillars. Avery looked for any source of real light, perhaps a skylight for the Sun to peek through, but there was nothing. Just crystal, and magic, if she dared to think. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sitting in a line by the wall sat about six people, but people different from the ones thriving in the settlement. These elders—all women—sat in beds of furs and pillows. They wore shawls decorated in animal bones and gemstones that twinkled whenever they moved. Twigs stuck out from their greying hair and gaudy rings weighed down their bony fingers. A few young children took care of them, but something more than the presence of a crowd froze Avery to the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The serene, sickly-looking grandmothers drew Avery in. They showed more dominance than her principal at school, more than her mother when a deadline drew near. With their elegance, their servants, and their age that showed their wisdom, Avery took a step back from what felt like beloved Goddesses. She’d disrupted them. She had to apologize to them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A grandmother with blue eyes looked up. “Finally, she came down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of the other grandmothers, one who could stand by herself, pointed a judgemental finger towards Avery. “Who gave you permission to enter? Why’re you here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery’s voice failed her. The power these women had slammed her against the wall. She couldn’t stand when adults got upset with her, but a grandparents’ anger equated to getting slapped across the face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kickstarting her voice, Avery yelled, “I’m sorry!” and ran through the room. She kept her head down out of respect and out of shame. Hopping over a stream glittering blue, she ran for the only other door in the room and pushed it open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She began to pant. She didn’t know where else to go, whom to speak to, or how to get out of this labyrinth without conflict. Excluding those logs pressed into the incline she’d fallen from, she hadn’t found any stairs leading up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Checking behind her to see if she’d lost the two boys, Avery tripped down a short, hidden staircase and landed hard on her shoulder. Wet dirt pushed against her mouth. She spat it out, tasting nothing but rolly pollies.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A pond lay before her, but it was a pond unlike any pond she’d come across in the forests. This one stretched out 200 feet. Quiet waterfalls aided to its lengths from high above. Pockets of water dipped around boulders and eroded stalagmites. Not a lot of vegetation grew here, but with the help of tiny pockets of sunlight dozens of feet up, grass had formed at the pond’s murky bottom. A few fish splashed away when Avery fell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery dusted off her now throbbing knees and walked to someplace drier. She hiked to a small cliffside overlooking the pond. Finally alone, she curled into a hurt ball and let herself breathe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t. Even though she’d finally found an opening to the outside world, the air here didn’t circulate well. And she was still lost. She hadn’t proved her parents wrong. After becoming a middle schooler, Avery still felt as hopeless as she felt two years ago in her school’s bathroom, crying about who she’d become.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quiet sniffling burned her irritated eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Making sure no other cave people had come in to detain her, Avery quietly sobbed into her torn sleeves. Her emotions puddled at her shoes like the waterfalls around her. Their blubbering masked Avery’s snorts and hiccups.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Footsteps echoed across the pond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery jolted upright and tried clearing her face before she got discovered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy with the scarred face ended his jog wheezing. He held the side of a crystallized rock and coughed out a dry cough before detecting Avery’s tear-stricken face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery yanked down her beanie to hide her eyes. She knew she ugly cried; nobody, especially a pretty boy her age, needed to see the worst side of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy climbed up to meet her. Still panting, he pushed back his bangs to see her clearly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry I’m so embarrassing,” she apologized, knowing how awful that sounded when spoken aloud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sitting back on his butt like a child, the boy sighed and dug something out of his poncho.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hidden against his chest shined a long necklace entangled with gemstones. Playing with one of the gems with care, he then waddled over on his knees and placed it around Avery’s neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It weighed down her neck with how heavy it was. Each gemstone had been wrapped carefully with grass and twine, keeping them safe. When in the right light, the facets and corners shined the colors of the rainbow.</span>
</p><p>
  <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/bd4fddffdcae62b12f0cfc4e5c895eec/tumblr_pbiofoJr9g1qmqh98o2_1280.png" alt="" width="640" height="397" data-pagespeed-url-hash="75686424" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery picked up a rainbow-colored gem and admired it in the limited light. “Pretty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy said something and pointed to the gem.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What language are you speaking?” Avery asked. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Language</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Talking. Speech.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy pursed his lips, waiting for a better explanation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rubbing her sore leg, she asked, “Do you have a name?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy looked up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Name?” Avery asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Name—</span>
  <em>
    <span>Naam</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” he clarified. “Cameron.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cameron?” She pointed to herself; she’d heard them speak that name near the mud huts, but she hadn’t been sure. “I’m Avery. Avery Marlow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Avery.” He poked her arm too hard. “Avery!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Ja</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jah?” Avery giggled, though it hurt too much. She cradled her injured side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron lost his playful smile and touched Avery’s thigh, making her jump back. He said something with grave concern, then checked behind them before taking her hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’re we going?” she asked, and she wasn’t sure, but under Cameron’s breath, she thought he said, “The Healers.”</span>
</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Cameron tried their hardest not to cough in front of the girl. The chase had burned out their lungs and their vision had gotten blurrier than usual, but they needed to help this girl, Avery. Parting from their personal gemmes always stung, but they’d worked their wonderful magic yet again. They’d gotten Avery to stop crying. She was smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sitting up slowly so their vision didn’t blot out, Cameron took Avery’s hand and led her away from the Lake. They’d never entered the Lake Den without being given a task or errand to run. They weren’t a water cleanser, so they had no business around so much pure water. They knew their way around sure enough, but they couldn’t help but trace the thin lines making up their kaart, wondering when they’d walk this path again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery pointed to the scars.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My kaart,” Cameron explained. They wanted to go on describing such an important part of themselves—literally—but they withheld themselves. She wouldn’t understand. The kaart was carved into each Arkęh:nen’s arm at thirteen so they never got lost. Families around the Community would celebrate the momentous milestone with fresh meat and candles for everyone to enjoy. After their disastrous cave-in, Cameron had earned theirs a year earlier than most. Not many neighbors had celebrated with Cameron and their Moeder. Basil and Maywood had, though. They’d shared a gutted squirrel together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not knowing how to explain all of that to Avery, Cameron just said, “It helps us get through the tunnles so we don’t get lost.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Avery said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron led her out by hand, away from the Lake. And the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Grandmoeders’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>Den. A shiver crawled up their neck. Avery, an </span>
  <em>
    <span>Autrean</span>
  </em>
  <span>, had barged in to the Grandmoeders’ Den without knowing about their culture or their laws. Luckily, Cameron had shielded their eyes quick enough. Seeing the Grandmoeders without being called down would brandish you with shame for the rest of your life. Hopefully the Grandmoeders would be lenient with Avery’s misdoing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like Cameron thought, a crowd had begun to form around the tunnle entrance. The Community held up firebug lanterns and glowing gemmes to see them better. They asked Avery questions and touched her long hair. Each time they got too close, Avery ducked away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s scared,” Cameron told them. “Please don’t do that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’d you find her, Cameron?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you bring her down yourself?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do the Grandmoeders know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did any psychics predict this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not wanting to stir up any rumors, Cameron nudged themselves out of the crowd and headed home. People less overbearing but equally snoopy peeped around the ville shoppes to get a better look at the Autrean girl. One woman, Claire, a friend of Cameron’s mother, came out not with questions but with a jar of her famous honey wrapped in a blade of river grass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here, take this,” she said, handing it to Cameron. “It was collected earlier this morning and purified by the psychics. It should help calm you and her down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure?” Cameron asked, noting how heavy the bottle felt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but be quick. The energy’s tense here. People are whispering. Best to use this in a secluded, calming spot, and drink it slowly and meaningfully.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will. Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Claire gave an acknowledging nod to Avery before running her hand through Cameron’s poofy hair. “Take care, Cameron.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” they said, and ran down the nearest rock staircase. The steep steps took Avery by surprise—she grabbed hold of Cameron’s shoulders to keep from falling—but Cameron supported her and escaped to the second level of Arkęh:na.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their dens had been built down here more than 350 years ago by their brave ancestors. Racism, slavery, and war had driven them down, away from so much evil plaguing the Autre world. As the decades passed and war between Indians and pilgrims advanced, those who still weren’t safe began to dig deeper. Word about this lifestyle became favorable to those seeking freedom, and so their ancestors kept digging until reason to communicate with the outside world shriveled up. They blocked out the entrances and nobody went looking for those they saw as outcasts. Soon their existence faded away like a bedtime story’s origin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron was a sixth generation Arkęh:nen and prided themselves on keeping up their heritage. Everything their ancestors had given up for Cameron’s safety weighed down on their every move. This meant taking care of everyone who needed help.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was why they’d chosen the pronoun “they,” a distinguished yet slightly outdated pronoun only the most dedicated Arkęh:nen used. Instead of being a “he” or a “she,” becoming a “they” meant that everything you did affected those around you. You became the Community you were so entwined with. When Cameron had first learned about this, they’d proudly announced to their classroom to call them a “they” instead of their old pronoun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Each den had decorative drapery acting as their door. Some had animal pelts: sewn-together furs of squirrels and rabbits. Some, like Cameron’s den, had an antique blanket a Grandmoeder had sewn for them in their spare time. Whenever Cameron passed by it, they rubbed the soft, ancient fabric, feeling the energy their own birth Grandmoeder had put into it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron basically lived by themselves. Their Fader had died when they were four and their Moeder barely left the psychic den. With extra room, Cameron had filled their 100-square-foot space with gemmes. Gemmes in boxes, gemmes standing upright against the dirt walls. Over the course of their life, Cameron had excavated around 2,000 gemmes, but had only kept around 200. The rest became gifts of kindness for the Community.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Cameron draped their quilt back over the door, they escorted Avery inside of their bed, a hole cut deep into the rocky floor. With her size, she could’ve easily rested her chin on the edge, but she didn’t. She instead pulled herself into a ball and sat quietly in one of the jagged corners.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron offered her the jar of honey. “You can eat this to calm down.” They pretended to drink down the bottle. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Eat</span>
  </em>
  <span>. It’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Eaten</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Sniffing its top, Avery tipped her head back to taste it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She dropped the bottle and pointed above her in horror.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had her eyes set on Cameron’s bat, Nuvu, who was hanging upside down on the metal mesh Basil had scavenged for them and hammered into the wall. The gemme she was supposed to deliver to Maywood announcing the arrival of an Autrean was still in her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s my bat,” Cameron explained. “Nuvu.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Introducing herself, Nuvu dropped the gemme on Avery’s head and chittered at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Nuvu</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Avery asked, picking up the gemme.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. She kind of hates people. I’m not even sure if she likes me.” They took back the gemme. “Do Autreans even know what bats are? They only live in caves and only like Arkęh:nen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery shrugged and lapped the hardened honey circling the top of the jar. It reminded Cameron of how Nuvu ate honey, but with her wide eyes and scratched face, she looked much cuter and less likely to bite one of Cameron’s fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to learn more about you,” Cameron confessed. “We’re not allowed to talk to Autreans if we ever see one in the wild. I’ve never even seen one before. Basil’s half-Autrean, but he was born and raised here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery nodded and pulled something out of her pocket. Before Cameron could ask, that bright light blinded them yet again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry!” Avery lowered the brightness, but Cameron still needed to squint to see. Basil had told them stories about these bright glasses. Autreans called them “fones.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery tapped something on her fone and showed it to Cameron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though it hurt, Cameron moved up closer to see the moving picture. It was of a blue and green orb surrounded by darkness. White—clouds, maybe—stretched around it as it spun like a ball.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cool,” Cameron said in awe. “How’s it doing that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery clicked her fone and a new picture popped up, one of green trees and mossy logs: her world. The Autre world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Biting their lower lip, Cameron took the fone and kept scrolling. They weren’t allowed to enter the Autre world, but could they see pictures of it? They hoped so, because they’d never, ever felt this much joy from something outside of Arkęh:na. These pictures didn’t move, but it didn’t matter. The endless rivers not cut off by rock, the flowers growing with help from the Sun. How far did the sky stretch? How tall did the trees grow? Arkęh:na had its tight-knit charm, but this was world-altering.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they frantically searched for more pictures, Cameron stumbled across a picture not blessed by earthly qualities, but by graphite.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’d come to understand an Autrean’s way of writing. Having neither the tree supply nor the light for it, Arkęh:nen hardly ever wrote, but from time to time, scavengers would sneak back papers for the Community to see. They always gathered a crowd whenever a book came down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In these photos, it seemed like someone had taken pictures of drawings. The sketchy, smudged people had been drawn with exaggerated features, particularly in the eyes and hair. They all looked sad for some reason, but beautiful nonetheless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Stammering, Avery yanked back her fone and hid away the pictures.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you draw those?” Cameron asked. “Avery, you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, me.” She filtered through the pictures much quicker, as if too shy to show off her own work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you teach me how to draw?” Cameron insisted. “Can you draw me? No Arkęh:nen is good at drawing, and these are incredible!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery beamed red. She blushed so easily that Cameron couldn’t stop themselves from feeding her more praise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron’s curtain pushed back. Basil stood in the open doorway, panting. He’d finally freed himself of all those silkworms, but he still looked upset, especially when he saw Avery sitting in Cameron’s bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Basil, do you know how these fones work?” Cameron asked. “Avery’s an artist. She has drawings—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Moeder,” Basil interrupted, “she’s on her way. She found out, and she’s looking for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Cameron could react, Basil looked down the corridor, choked on his own spit, and ran away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The curtain parted once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron’s Moeder, one of the most paramount psychics in all of Arkęh:na, stood in the doorway with her hands on her hips, glaring down at Cameron and Avery.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew I shouldn’t have left you alone this morning,” she said. “Bring her here, then. I’ll deal with her myself.”</span>
</p><p>

  <p>
  <span>Whatever mood Avery had created with Cameron died when the woman walked in. She looked like a mom, so nothing like Avery’s own mother: wide hips, shoulder-length hair, a somewhat wrinkled face. She wore a poncho similar to Cameron’s, but around her waist like a skirt, and she wore more gemstones than he did. The rings on her fingers looked like they cost a grand each.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The woman leaned her head out of the room, yet didn’t take her eyes off of Avery. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Basil</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At once, Basil, the silkworm boy, ran back and bowed his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The woman said more to Basil in their shared language, then invited herself into Cameron’s room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron scampered out of his bed/hole so the woman had a place to sit. She took it graciously and sat legs folded in front of Avery, and a sense of drowning filled up the hole. Not even Avery’s own mother’s anger commanded so much from Avery, with those stern eyes and unblinking stare. If this woman had told Avery to run out of the hole and never come back, Avery would be sprinting away before she’d finish her demand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron and Basil squatted at the edge of the bed hole like gargoyles, waiting for the woman to speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The woman started speaking. Once she finished, Basil said, “Uh, this is…Moeder of Cameron, Moeder Ellinor. She is great psychic, the best. She will help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you translating for her?” Avery asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have to,” he said. “I shouldn’t, although. You cannot be here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moeder Ellinor started speaking again, quieting Basil. She reached out for Avery’s arm and pushed up her sweater to examine the bruises. While talking, she took out an old container of paste and spread it over the gnarlier wounds. Avery couldn’t tell her to stop, mostly because she trusted this “Moeder’s” actions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What felt like a bumblebee stung directly inside of the wound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ow!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moeder Ellinor kept a firm hand on Avery’s wrist, keeping her from pulling away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It has to sting,” Basil interpreted. “Mushroom medicine, it’s fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But mushrooms are poisonous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basil sneered. “You think we know not about mushrooms? We’re more smarter than you Autreans.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron asked something to his Moeder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moeder Ellinor shook her head, then checked Avery’s forehead temperature with her forearm. She too had scars marking her inner forearm, although hers was faded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She…wants you to see that…you’re mysterious,” Basil explained, then muttered something under his breath that made Cameron hit him. He continued, “However…you are welcome here, in Arkęh:na.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Ar-kay-nah</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This, our home, us people. You should…not stay long, although. Most—</span>
  <em>
    <span>All</span>
  </em>
  <span>— Arkęh:nen hate Autreans, you people from the surface. We help…everyone, although we shouldn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moeder Ellinor snapped at Basil, hushing him up. He even covered his mouth so he didn’t disrespect himself in front of this profound woman.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moeder Ellinor spoke directly to Avery.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She asks if you hurt in more places,” Basil said through his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Avery lied, still feeling the pain from the paste, “but thank you for helping me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basil tried interpreting to Cameron and the Moeder, which Avery deduced meant “mother.” She did look a lot like Cameron, but Basil acted as if she was his mother as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moeder Ellinor rubbed the top of Avery’s hand, addressed something to Cameron, and began to stand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A soft bell dinged throughout the room. It ran above Cameron’s door. The string attached to it was getting yanked by someone impatient.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The three cave people bolted upright and stared at the bell until it stopped. They didn’t say anything, they didn’t react. They waited as if to hear dire news from a primitive air raid siren.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Crap</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Basil whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moeder Ellinor jumped out of the bed hole and jogged out of the den.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron, shaken, helped Avery out as Basil cursed in more broken English.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does the bell mean?” Avery asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Grandmoeders call us,” Basil said. “This is trouble. We shouldn’t be doing this. Bad—” He complained more to Cameron in their language, but Cameron didn’t listen and held Avery’s hand tighter, assuring her that everything would be fine. It didn’t calm her down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery tripped trying to keep up with Basil and Moeder Ellinor. Cameron took smaller, nervous steps down the ladders and through Arkęh:na’s halls. Families looked out of their homes to watch them go. Many of them quickly peeked out of their curtains, the hid themselves so as not to be caught ogling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They climbed back to the second floor, Moeder Ellinor acting as their leader. Now more people than ever—almost three hundred—stood around in the shopping district, gossiping and pointing out Avery as she ran. Avery tried to hide her face, but Cameron took her hand and led her towards the tunnel leading to the grandmothers’ home, the “Grandmoeders” as Basil called them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An attendant who’d been catering to the Grandmoeders hid behind the moss-covered door. They whispered secrets to Moeder Ellinor, then glared at Avery as they passed over their lantern. Likely ordered to do so, they creaked open the door and escorted them inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The eldest Grandmoeder, the one who’d first talked to Avery when she’d stormed through, raised her bony hand. Half of its weight must’ve come from all the jewels and bracelets weighing it down. “Come in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They all moved forwards as if on a conveyor belt. Basil, however, was stopped at the door, unable to enter by the Grandmoeders’ henchmen. He didn’t argue, but he looked scorned when the door closed on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somehow, entering the Grandmoeders’ Den with purpose made Avery more nervous. Now three out of the five Grandmoeders sat up in their elevated beds, while the other two stayed wrapped in their heavy quilts. Avery couldn’t see their faces. They looked asleep, or dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron and his mother knelt before the Grandmoeders, Moeder Ellinor with grace, Cameron with some difficulty. His knees kept cracking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery copied with little instruction. The stream trickling through the room encircled them like a prison cell, keeping them from moving around too much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Raise your heads.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Grandmoeder spoke in Arkęh:na’s language, whatever they called it, but it sounded similar to English, enough for Avery to follow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kind Grandmoeder smiled down at them, while the other two cast down scowls. The one who’d yelled at Avery to get out had a bulging vein in her wrinkled neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome to our home, Autrean,” the nice Grandmoeder said in English. “My name is Grandmoeder Geneva. I see you’ve met my daughter Ellinor and her child Cameron.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At hearing their names, Moeder Ellinor and Cameron bowed their heads even deeper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Avery said. “Thank you for taking me in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Company is good for the soul. It keeps it less lonely. As you might’ve guessed by out Community’s reaction, we don’t get many Autreans down here very often. It came as quite a shock, being that the day has just started for us. I ask you this: How did you happen across our settlement?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I tripped,” Avery said, keeping her voice steady. “I was resting my back against the wall and it caved in. That’s when Cameron found me. He helped me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Grandmoeder next to Grandmoeder Geneva grumbled something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My friend wishes to address,” said Grandmoeder Geneva, “that the pronoun you use on my grandchild is wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh?” Avery asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cameron Quinn is neither a boy nor a girl, neither woman nor man. They have chosen to call themselves by the Community’s multiple pronoun of ‘they’. They are a ‘they’, you see, not a ‘he’, so be sure to know that when addressing them properly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery looked to Cameron, who must’ve heard his name and was now waiting for translation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery had never known anyone go by a different pronoun than the pronoun they looked like. He looked like a boy. Had she gotten it wrong again?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sudden embarrassment welled up inside of Avery as she lost the strength to look at her new friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nevertheless,” Grandmoeder Geneva continued, “we’re happy you’re here. Interaction between us and Autreans is limited, so any new encounter is recognized.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I ask something?” Avery ventured. “I don’t want to step out of line, but how, I mean, </span>
  <em>
    <span>why </span>
  </em>
  <span>do live in caves? How long have you been down here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have been here for generations, ever since the pilgrims voyaged across the ocean in search of new land. Our ancestors hid themselves within the rock to avoid persecution for being themselves. As time grew, we decided it’d be best to stay away from the surface, to keep our heritage safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do the surface people—us Autreans—know about you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re the first of your generation to visit us. We’ve had a few Autreans find our caves, but they had malicious intentions, and we drove them away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Best of her to keep this secret to herself,” seethed the angry Grandmoeder. “You shan’t be telling other Autreans about us, do you understand?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I-I won’t say anything,” Avery said. “I don’t have any friends, so I have no one to tell.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grandmoeder Geneva smiled. She had no teeth. “Is that true? Do you really have no friends?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, and my parents don’t care about what I do, so they won’t care where I’ve been.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe that’s true,” she said, and beckoned for one of her servants. They brought her a bag.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My backpack,” Avery said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The servant gave her another object crackling with energy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My walkie-talkie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Such a curious machine,” Grandmoeder Geneva said, playing with the attanae between her fingers. She gave it back to the servant, who rushed it to Avery. “However separate you are from your parents, I’m sure they must be waiting for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery checked her phone. It was nearly six. “I think you’re right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Before you leave, though, I must tell you one more thing: Your presence here has affected our Community in a way we haven’t felt in a long time. Some of us”—she nodded her head to the angry-looking Grandmoeder—“still hold prejudices against Autreans, but I believe you can help us see a light we haven’t basked in for several centuries. May I ask, if you wish, that you come by once more?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/3f045cf9f75e465be90693f909fcba4b/tumblr_pbv792spG21qmqh98o3_r2_1280.png" alt="" width="640" height="397" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1503743117" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery lifted her head. “I can come back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you wish to learn more,” she said, then smiled just as widely as Avery did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Avery said, somewhat out of breath. “I’d love to. This place is incredible—you’re all incredible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re quite kind,” Grandmoeder Geneva said. “Now, your parents must be worried, as I believe it’s late in Autrean standards.” She turned to Cameron and Moeder Ellinor and spoke to them in their language, something Avery now wanted to learn more than ever. They both nodded with everything she told them, then stood up at the exact same time when she finished speaking. Cameron’s Moeder went to the Grandmoeder’s bedsides so they could whisper more discreetly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Watching, Cameron took Avery’s hand yet again. He was a very physical person.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or she.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or they.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crowds outside had finally receded into the villages and Cameron snuck Avery back into the tunnel they’d first met without hassle. Clumps of dirt from when she’d fallen now collected at the bottom. Someone had pushed the boulder back into place. Now only Cameron’s lantern provided them light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two of them stood there, waiting for either Avery to start climbing or for Cameron to leave. Neither moved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry if I got you and your mom in trouble,” Avery said. “Were those your elders or something, like a counsel? The Grandmoeders?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Grandmoeders,” Cameron said. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish I knew your language. I could teach you English and you can teach me…Arkęh:nen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At that special name drop, Cameron smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well.” Avery bit her inner cheek. “Bye.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron pointed to Avery’s chest, and only when Avery looked down did she realize they were pointing to their necklace and not something else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Sorry.” She went to give it back, but Cameron stopped her. Shaking their head, they let Avery keep the heavy necklace with hesitant hands, as if they didn’t actually want to let them go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure?” Avery asked, to which Cameron nodded, but if they understood her, she didn’t know.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neither of them moved. In the darkest light, they stood still knowing this might’ve been the last time either of them saw their kind again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that wasn’t true. She’d promised to return to these interconnected tunnles as many times as she could. Her parents would question her extended visits into the woods, but she’d think of an excuse later. Like she could tell them about everything she’d just uncovered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery’s cellphone vibrated in her hands. Her mother texted her asking where she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Being the catalyst she needed, Avery gave Cameron one last wordless look before she left up the ladder.</span>

  <p>As Avery climbed out of Arkęh:na, her heart picked up where it’d left off. Darkness had fallen through the forest and she couldn’t see or hear either of her dogs. She’d totally forgotten about them. Ever since the fall, all of her thoughts and emotions had gotten scrambled, like she’d been in a haze until she resurfaced to the real world.</p><p>As she placed the rock back into place, she looked around the empty, suddenly uninteresting cave for help.</p><p>A loud barking echoed throughout the cave, and before Avery made sure it wasn’t police dogs searching for her missing body, Oreo barreled into her. He got so excited with his kisses that he nipped her hat off of her head.</p><p>Avery used her remaining strength to push him off and stand up. “Where’s Pumpkin?”</p><p>Oreo nuzzled Avery’s hair. His fur was slick with rain and mud.</p><p>Finally outside the cave, Avery’s walkie-talkie sparked back to life. She walked in circles for reception. “Mom?”</p><p>She waited about three seconds before she heard a crash. “Avery? Avery, is that you?”</p><p>“I’m here.”</p><p>“Where’ve you <em> been </em>?” her mother almost shouted. “I’ve been trying to get a hold of you for almost an hour! Are you okay?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then come home! It’s supposed to rain any second—I’m watching the weather channel right now. Get home!”</p><p>Avery stared at her walkie-talkie as droplets of rain dripped off the cave entrance. After about ten minutes of processing, she made sure she had everything stored safely in her backpack before jogging back home. Oreo, finally with his owner, trotted faithfully behind her.</p><p>She started at a slow pace, but soon found herself running, her fingers wound up around Cameron’s necklace. She ran through streams she’d usually avoid, jumped over rocks she’d normally walk around. She didn’t care who saw her as she laughed hard enough for rain to land in her mouth. Instead of complaining about the rain, her parents’ fury, or Arkęh:na, Avery laughed at the thought that, for once, she’d finally found a friend who wouldn’t know about her past.</p><p>She got home ten minutes later than normal.</p><p>Pumpkin barked in the garage. She’d tipped over her water dish and spilled it across the cement floor. Oreo met with her in nose snuggles and bites at her white paws.</p><p>Avery caught her breath outside of her home. The garage lights were left on either for her or for her father who might’ve been doing yard work. Whatever the reason, Avery grabbed hold of her two dogs, turned off the light, and came home.</p><p>Her mother and father were exactly where she’d left them: her mother at the dining room table, her father in the kitchen. But both of them weren’t working. They had their phones in their hands, pacing. Her mother balanced all of her weight on her cane as she made her way towards her daughter.</p><p>“Sorry,” Avery said.</p><p>“Why was Pumpkin here before you? Where were you? Why didn’t you pick up?”</p><p>Avery dared to look down at her phone, but she couldn’t break eye contact with her mother. “I…found this pond. It had, uh, koi in it. I was wondering who they belonged to and went door to door. I was so busy talking with this one woman, I forgot to call in. My walkie was in my…bag.”</p><p>Avery’s mother checked her daughter’s torn leggings. “You’re hurt.”</p><p>“I tried to get a closer look at the koi, but I tripped on the rocks and fell. I think that’s why my walkie-talkie wasn’t picking up any signals.”</p><p>“Let me see it,” her father said. “I’ll work on it tonight and get it fixed.”</p><p>“Why was there koi fish in the forest?” her mother asked. “Who did they belong to?”</p><p>“I’m not sure. I think they’ve been living there all alone for years. There were so many of them, I think they just learned to live in the wild.”</p><p>“Well, koi fish live an awfully long time in the wild,” her father said.</p><p>“When have koi fish ever been able to live by themselves?” her mother asked, but went towards the dining table, back to work now that her daughter had flown back to them.</p><p>“We already ate,” Avery’s father said, “but I’ve sectioned up the leftovers and put them back in the fridge. Yours is on top.”</p><p>The fresh taste of Arkęh:nen honey still lingered on Avery’s tongue, but she couldn’t go to bed without eating something. After washing her hands of cave dirt and seating her two dogs on their signature cushions, Avery made herself a plate of cheesy potatoes and lamb. Avoiding any more questions about her totally unbelievable story, she ascended up the stairs to her room.</p><p>She bit her knuckle as she jogged in place. A thousand questions and hypotheses ran through her head and escaped through her ears. Abandoning her food on her bedside table, Avery kicked off her boots and clothes and jumped into the shower to clean off any ticks.</p><p>How did showers work in Arkęh:na? The caves smelled a little like smelly armpits, but all caves had their own special tang to them. Maybe they showered in that lake, which they then streamed out of the caves so they didn’t accidentally drink it. Did they repurpose it? Did they shower outside in secrecy so no surface person found them? Did they even shower at all?</p><p>Were there more communities like Arkęh:na throughout America?</p><p>Were they safe?</p><p>Were they okay?</p><p>Head swirling with possibilities, Avery faceplanted in bed, her hair still damp. The Grandmoeders had told her that she’d been one of the only teenagers to have discovered Arkęh:na. If so, how many people on the internet knew as well?</p><p>Wiggling towards the edge of her bed, Avery unearthed her laptop hidden between her boxes of memories. As it booted up, she couldn’t stop playing with Cameron’s gifted necklace. The twine felt as sturdy as metal, and each of the gemstones seemed to shine with magic. There’d been so many gems in Cameron’s room; had they polished these gems themselves?</p><p>Searching for ‘CAVE PEOPLE’ felt too wide of a net to cast, but typing in ‘CAVE PEOPLE HISTORY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK’ worried Avery; what if the government had begun tracking her and was now monitoring her internet history?</p><p>Rolling her fingers over the trackpad, Avery typed in the question she wanted to know most: ‘IS THE PRONOUN ‘THEY’ A VALID PRONOUN FOR A SINGULAR PERSON TO USE?’</p><p>It was.</p><p>Then she asked: ‘HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE WITH SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THAN YOU DO?’</p><p>With the amount of information she suddenly had, Avery took out some spare paper and wrote down everything she could. Within ten minutes she’d written complex essays and theses that put her English grades to shame. She found famous hermits living in caves, but they were nothing compared to Arkęh:na. She found Amish towns and African tribes that reminded her so much of the Community, but different. Little bits of cultures from all around the world had been mashed together to create what Arkęh:na had created for itself.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>Just as Avery started her third page of notes, a corner of her computer brought up a pop-up screen. She went to close it, thinking it a virus, then saw the username.</p><p>xxCrossingRiverxx07.</p><p>That username, that profile picture of a wilted rose, Avery had nightmares about them. It’d once been a godsend to her to see that username come up during the late hours of the night. Now she could barely look at it.</p><p>But she couldn’t help but check on Bridget’s statuses and moods illustrated by a tiny emoticons.</p><p>Today, she’d dropped another song quote with a puzzled emoticon beside it.</p><p>A conversation dinged underneath Avery’s username.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Hey. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Was what you said to me this summer true? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Avery made sure not to start writing so Bridget wasn’t aware that she’d seen the message.

  <p>
  <span>For the first time in their life, Cameron eagerly awaited for a friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that they were a particularly unfriendly person. Rather, Cameron knew they’d inherited their mother’s care and their father’s awkwardness, leaving them in a tidepool of unease. And most Arkęh:nen knew about Cameron’s lack of magical talent; whenever Cameron could offer their help, nobody wanted it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery was different. Avery didn’t know about Cameron’s faults.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of putting all of their energy into gemme hunting, Cameron waited right next to the Main Exit Tunnle with extra bright firebugs. They wanted to be the first one to greet Avery once she returned, to keep that spark between them alive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two days passed and the firebugs slowly flickered out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the second lonely night came and went, Cameron let their bugs rest and sulked back home. Never before had they waited on somebody like this before, so anxious to meet someone new. Their Fader’s death and their Moeder’s distance left Cameron finding their own devices for entertainment. They had exploring, gemmes, and family friends, but they’d never explored beyond that. They’d never explored outside of Arkęh:na.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yawning shopkeepers began putting away their wares and kissing their neighbors goodnight. The Centrum had cleared out of restful teens and the artisans had doused out their cooking fires. Claire had just boarded up her honey shoppe when Cameron passed by. Cameron had been keeping the honey jar she’d given them had Avery ever returned, but it’d been two days. Others needed the delicacy that Cameron was holding onto so selfishly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Claire waved Cameron over. “You’re still up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I can’t sleep.” Cameron pulled out the honey bottle. “Here. Avery didn’t drink it all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t want it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron did, but instead they said, “Somebody else can have it. Do you need help packing up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cameron, I’m fine, and take it. You </span>
  <em>
    <span>were </span>
  </em>
  <span>the one who introduced an Autrean here. I’ve heard the Grandmoeders are quite interested in her. You’re making them very happy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A prideful dizziness clouded Cameron’s head. “I’ve heard.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never seen your Grandmoeder so energized. You must be quite proud.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron touched their face, hiding their bursting ego. Arkęh:nen dreamed of being minor influences to the matriarchy. To think the Grandmoeders were thinking of them in a positive light and not as an annoyance made Cameron’s heart beat faster than usual.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A clatter erupted near the Centrum. Shoppe owners jumped with their boxes in hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron frowned. They only knew a few people who’d desecrate the peacefulness of the Centrum with needless aggression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basil had a boy named Patchway on his back. Maywood was on her knees trying to pull Basil back, but it seemed like a fruitless endeavor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Storing the honey in their poncho, Cameron ran over to Basil and said, “Basil, knock it off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At Cameron’s voice, Basil let the boy go, watching as he hopped off the steps and ran away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s been the matter with you lately?” Maywood asked him. “He didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>do </span>
  </em>
  <span>anything to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He pushed you!” Basil said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knocked into </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span>. It was an accident.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron helped Maywood back on her wobbly feet, then handed her her fallen walking stick. She’d been born with too long of limbs, giving her a small hunchback and legs that tired out quicker than Cameron’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You gotta stop letting people walk all over you,” Basil said. “I’m not always gonna be here to—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To protect me?” Maywood asked, arching her eyebrow. “How did that protect me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sputtering, Basil took off towards the silkworm huts, his arms bent at ninety degrees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He won’t do any better working there,” Maywood said. “He’s been so fired up lately.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did he get into another fight with your Moeder?” Cameron asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I think it’s because of that Autrean girl.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Avery.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. He was bad-mouthing her all day in our den. I think it’s because she’s being seen as someone new and interesting even though she’s an Autrean. Basil…isn’t thought of like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron nodded and sat next to Maywood on the steps. Basil did own the dark skin and hair of an Autrean. He had a nose and jaw unlike anyone in the Community. Once he was born, the Community reacted like a bear had been spotted in the tunnles. Rumors spread. Their Fader left. Basil grew up with everyone whispering his name behind his back. Cameron had never cared that much about the difference until Basil woke up as a six-year-old and realized that people treated him differently than his sister. Then he iced over and isolated himself from everyone who still loved him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think it’s also about our Moeder, of course,” Maywood added, “but I don’t wish to bore you with our lives.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled, but it was forced. “I hardly ever see her anymore. She’s been booking meetings with your Moeder for readings, sometimes taking four-hour sessions, and she’s stopped sleeping with us in our den. I think she either sleeps here or with her friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because of Avery or because of Basil?” Cameron asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This’s been going on for a while,” she answered. “Basil’s just turned fifteen, you know, the height of being an adult. I think she’s planning on kicking him out to find his own den.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Cameron said, taken aback. “She wouldn’t. You’re still living there, and you’re almost eighteen. My own Moeder’s still living in her birth den. I’m planning on staying there until I have kids or a cave-in forces me out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maywood smirked. “A cave-in that you’ll create?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maywood laughed and stood up with her cane. “I should make sure Basil doesn’t punch a wall and cause that cave-in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you need help? Do you want this?” Cameron offered her the honey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m okay. Back when Basil still had his job as a scavenger, he brought me bottles and bottles of honey. It tastes too sweet for me now. Ask that Avery girl to bring some new foods here. The scavengers always tell us about how nice their food smells, I think it’s time we try it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Knowing she could get out of the Centrum by herself, Cameron went back to their den with their spirits a bit higher.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Technically, their Moeder did still live in their den, but Cameron’s path hardly ever crossed hers. Her hours at the psychics’ den kept her there for days at a time. Catching her out of work was more of a miracle than having an Autrean land feet away from you.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, when Cameron entered their tunnle, they slowed their steps, hoping to hear their Moeder cleaning or resting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their den, excluding Nuvu, was empty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nuvu squeaked at Cameron as they entered. She hung upside down from her metal grate and cast evil eyes down at her owner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” Cameron said, reaching to pet her head. “She won’t come back anymore. It’s okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nuvu tried biting them, then stretched out her long, black wing and turned around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron understood. They’d found Nuvu as a starving, injured pup abandoned on a tunnle floor. Distrustful of humans, she slowly became familiarized with just a handful of faces. To have someone new enter her home must’ve broken whatever trust Cameron had created with her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before heading out to work, Cameron took a moment to breathe. Feeding their firebugs a bit of honey, they unhooked their lantern, stripped to their skin-tight suit, and knelt before their gemme collection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Each gemme attracted their own person like a child to their favorite parent. Cameron loved orange, yellow and white gemmes. They didn’t discriminate and picked up any gemme which called out to them, but these stones, the way they felt in Cameron’s hands, they held a magic within their cut, a spark Cameron had been seeking out for years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Choosing their most prized gemmes, Cameron laid down in their bed and positioned the gemmes on their upper chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The gemmes’ energies fed into Cameron’s body and replenished them with positivity. Their coolness mixed with Cameron’s warmth as they shared stories through Cameron’s skin. Their births, from specks in the rock to their hardening and beautiful crystallization. Years of potential, manifesting magic destined to help Cameron at this one moment in time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron felt up their throat, feeling drowned by their natural gifts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then they started to speak. You had to be alone to hear them, alone with just you and your worrying thoughts. In tiny whispers, the gemmes told Cameron that they needed to calm down, to not worry about things out of their control above or underneath Arkęh:na.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I want to,” Cameron whispered back. “I want back control. Everything feels dizzy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The gemmes told Cameron that it was because breathing was becoming more difficult for them and that they needed to tell their Moeder about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t,” Cameron said. “You know I can’t. I can’t worry her. I just want things to become calm again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Energy flowed too quickly into Cameron’s arms, glueing them to their blankets. In a motherly tone, the gemmes reminded Cameron that they lived on Earth and that Earth hadn’t been designed to be calm. That’s why wind always danced through the tunnles. That’s why waterfalls flowed. That’s why humans never stopped growing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All the concentration Cameron was putting into their gemmes and their conversation ended when Basil walked in. He excused himself and squatted beside Cameron’s bed, expecting Cameron to drop everything and tend to his worries.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Doing just that, Cameron sighed and sat up. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t meet with the Autrean girl again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron rolled their eyes and rolled one of their gemmes on their thigh. “She’s not like other Autreans. I don’t believe you when you say—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m telling the truth,” Basil stressed. “You haven’t met the Autreans like I have. They’re loud and mean and destroy the Earth. They’ll destroy you, too, if you get too close.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here we go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m only looking out for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/d3706b4388ee5c53dc5bc6daabbb4c3f/tumblr_pclhadaRzs1qmqh98o1_1280.png" alt="" width="610" height="378" data-pagespeed-url-hash="2378535020" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never asked you to look out for me,” Cameron told him for the 1,001st time. “You can’t control my life like this again. Who I choose to hang out with is my business.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basil lowered his head. His fingernails dug into his rabbit-fur slippers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Think about it,” Cameron said. “She’s an Autrean. If we get to know her, she might know something about your Fader. She might be able to lead you to him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basil’s eyes widened. “How did you know about that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he tried scrounging up a made-up reason, fear clawed down his neck and attached itself to his sweating face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait,” Cameron said. “Have you been trying to find your Fader? Have you been leaving Arkęh:na?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basil looked out to the tunnle, hearing for anyone eavesdropping.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Basil</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Cameron whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t tell anyone,” he begged. “I’ll stop. I won’t do it anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How could you leave without a group? You’re not a scavenger anymore. It’s not allowed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just a few weeks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Weeks</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leave it,” Basil said. “I won’t go out anymore. I can’t find anyone who looks like me, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You shouldn’t be going against your job,” Cameron pressed. “Please don’t go out anymore. Don’t upset the Community.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basil scratched underneath his tunic where his heart resided. Everyone knew that whenever you did something wrong, the Community felt it. Stealing, attacking, bad-mouthing, it weighed down on not only you, but your family as well. The shame in Basil’s face contrasted with the passion in his eyes that maybe, one day, he could meet his Fader.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What would you even say if you found him?” Cameron asked in a softer tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basil shrugged. “What would you say to your Fader if you met him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My Fader’s dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Fader’s missing,” Basil corrected.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He left to live on the surface when I was a child. He’s never coming back.” Cameron picked at their blanket fur. “But if I could, I’d ask why he left, why I wasn’t good enough for him to stay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not why he left,” Basil said. “The only reason anyone leaves is to be free. That’s why my Moeder left, I think, to feel what it’s like to be free. I just wished she’d tell me something about him. What he looked like, what his name was. Then I’d have a better time tracking him down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t track him down anymore. Ask Avery. I’m sure she’ll help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I don’t like her, Cameron. She’s not good enough for you.” He dusted off his knees. “Don’t tell your Moeder what I’ve been doing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have to tell her if she asks me, Basil. You know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sickly look overcame him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry. Maybe you can ask your Moeder for guidance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s the problem. She doesn’t talk to me anymore. Too Autrean for her liking, or not enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron gawked. “Don’t say that about your own Moeder.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever. Just don’t talk to that Autrean anymore.” Cursing Avery’s very name, Basil left, off to vent to someone else who could handle his feelings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron rolled two of their gemmes in their hand. If their Moeder actually asked, they wouldn’t really divulge everything to her. Still, thinking that Basil was leaving his home to find another troubled Cameron. If caught, he could be excommunicated from Arkęh:na entirely, forced to live in the woods with people who wouldn’t take kindly to his aggressive disposition.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron rested their forehead against their bed’s wall. Now alone, their gemmes whispered secrets in their ear. They said they didn’t want to be lonely anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you already have so many gemmes around you,” Cameron said, and put them back where they belonged. Then they noticed their excavating equipment resting near their door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Strapping on their bags and gloves, Cameron coughed out all the grit in their lungs and headed out for the tunnles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unlike the tunnles leading to everyone’s homes, the true tunnles, the ones that marked every Arkęh:nen’s right arm, led deep into the depths of the mountain. The ones with no lanterns, the ones that birthed the most energized gemmes. While Cameron loved every Arkęh:nen, their true loves awaiting them within the walls, hiding and ready to sparkle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron took the entrance closest to the Community dens. It was the one least used and made for the perfect escape for when life became too much even the psychics couldn’t help. The door hardly stood as a door anymore, just a rotten piece of bark meant to keep the drafts at bay, but Cameron liked that about this tunnle. It felt like keeping the better parts of a secret.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With no lantern affixed to the wall, Cameron stepped into the darkness and lost themselves within the mazes.</span>
</p>

  <p>
  <span>Cameron awoke in a cocoon of earthy darkness, entombed by the natural smell of soil. The feeling wrapped around them like a blanket until a stiff pain snapped down their neck and ached their shoulders. Moaning, they rolled onto their knees and shook the sleep out of their senses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took some time to find out exactly which tunnle Cameron had fallen asleep in. They touched the edges of the cave with restless eyes, found certain hanging rocks and stalagmites, and listened for which way the Rivière was winding through  the tunnles. It was faint, but when Cameron silenced themselves of thought and worry, they heard it flowing clearly, as if a channel flowed through their own ears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luckily, through the blessings of the glorious Grandmoeders, Cameron had fallen asleep near an Exit. They had memories of crossing bridges made of twine or exploring newly created waterfalls, but they must’ve passed out suddenly without realizing it. They couldn’t differentiate the comfort they felt  in the tunnles from their own bed hole.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The closest Exit led Cameron into the artisan shoppes. The silkworm farms had just opened for the morning. Workers were puffing fire bellows into quiet ashes as others carefully extracted warm pottery from the kilns.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron glanced around for either Maywood or Basil. They stayed clear of the psychic’s den in case they saw their Moeder, but as they secretly took peeks near it, they saw a strange scene: a completely desolate ville.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To make sure they weren’t losing their sight—a fear they had weekly nightmares about—Cameron checked inside the silkworm huts. Hundreds of tiny silkworms and silkworm cocoons rested safely in shelves built into the rock. Three older Arkęh:nen looked after them as they spun fresh silk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where is everyone?” Cameron asked them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We thought you heard,” one of them—Berr—said. “We thought you’d be the first one to see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Moeder was looking for you,” another one—Haides—said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Berr pointed out the window. “The Main Exit Tunnle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron leaned out of the hole to see what the two men were implying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>More than two-dozen Arkęh:nen lingered in the tunnle opening like mice trying to squeeze into the same hidey hole. They murmured as they stood on their tiptoes, trying to see something spectacular. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Stripping themselves of their mining equipment, Cameron tripped out of the hut and ran towards the Exit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Double the amount of Arkęh:nen were huddled within the cramped tunnle. Some balanced their babies on their shoulders while others climbed onto higher rock to see up ahead. No member of the Community acted this way unless one of two things happened: a person had died, or someone had brought down a treasure from the surface: a good roll of rope, glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A person.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron pushed passed the standstill crowd and made their way towards the center of it all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery stood amongst the curious with her arms tight at her sides. She smiled weakly, a defense mechanism to disarm a threat. Some pressing Arkęh:nen asked her questions, to which she just smiled harder and said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she smiled back at Cameron, though, she relaxed and gave them a real smile. Today, not only was she wearing a new outfit entirely, but she had Cameron’s treasured necklace still around her neck. She’d entangled her fingers through the twine as she them gave a small wave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron couldn’t control themselves and ran into her for a hug. She smelled sweeter than last time, like she’d touched a spot of honey around her ears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t hug back. She stood there, mute, and slowly, the awkwardness that grew between them forced Cameron back. She must’ve not enjoyed physical contact as much as they did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you’d never come back,” Cameron said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She said something in return.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I still can’t understand you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery shifted her weight on her heels. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>My</span>
  </em>
  <span>…</span>
  <em>
    <span>Moeder</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Moeder?” Cameron asked. “Your Moeder what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Moeder</span>
  </em>
  <span>…” She made a harsh X with her forearms, then pointed at herself, then to the top of the Exit hole. She pretended her fingers were walking down the decline.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Moeder forbade you from coming here?” To say this, Cameron copied her hand gestures with a confused look, and Avery nodded confidently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Satisfied that Avery now had a trustworthy companion with her, the Community dispersed. News that the Grandmoeders had allowed her to come back regularly must’ve stuck. Some eyes lingered on Avery for longer than what Cameron thought was necessary, but they left soon enough and allowed Cameron and Avery to enter back into Arkęh:na.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like before, Avery marvelled at the expanse of Arkęh:na. She turned in circles with a hand over her heart, her backpack her anchor, her smile suppressed, too nervous to show off true feelings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron picked the dirt out of their fingernails, then tapped Avery on her shoulder and pointed her towards the Centrum.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat together on the best throw pillows filled with the fluffiest goose feathers. While Avery pulled something out of her pack, she looked up to the pillars holding up the Centrum ceiling and the lanterns spiraling around them. The amount of awe in her jaw left Cameron staring at how wide her eyes could go, how they twinkled for knowledge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe they just pretended to see that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery pulled out a thin book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron raised their brows. No one in Arkęh:na used books. The Community didn’t even see reading as required knowledge to have. The ends of maintaining the parchment, quills, and light didn’t justify the means, but the Autreans seemed to be keeping up the ancients traditions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron swung around a Centrum lantern for Avery to see.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” it sounded like she said, and opened up the book to the first page.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pictures of fully fleshed-out Autreans smiled up at Cameron. They looked so lifelike and </span>
  <em>
    <span>there</span>
  </em>
  <span> that, for a naive moment, Cameron believed them to be miniature people and not just pictures of them captured in time, these “fotos.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Basil had explained this strange technology to Cameron once before, about how Autreans could capture moments in time and paint them so quickly with absolute perfection. “Fones” could do this, as well as “kamras,” but it looked like Avery had somehow taken the pictures and placed them in this book for safekeeping.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron felt around the fotos’ corners. Avery had pictures of herself in broad daylight and of herself sitting on an elevated, fancy-looking bed. In some, Past Avery stood next to two other dark-skinned, dark-haired adults who looked just like her. She looked to be eight or nine, her hair just above her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Moeder,” Avery said, pointed to the woman, “and…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fader?” Cameron asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. Moeder Juniper and Fader Ethan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Avery,” Cameron said, touching her knee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Cameron.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their “ands” sounded so similar. Could they make more words like this, more questions? All Arkęh:nen had questions about Autrean life, but now Cameron had a perfect teacher to learn from.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fader?” Avery then asked. “Cameron’s…” She raised her shoulders and hands, posing a question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My Fader?” Cameron asked. “You want to know about my Fader?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron searched for the right words. They had no “fotos” of the man and no memories of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>He looked a lot like you</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” was the most Cameron had ever gotten from their Moeder. Along with his name: Erik.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without the Autreans words to tell her that, Cameron copied what Avery had done and made an X with their arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery seemed to understand. “Sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery flipped to the next page and started drawing something with a queer quill. She squinted as she drew, as if one lantern’s light wasn’t enough. Cameron noticed that tucked in her pocket was the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fone </span>
  </em>
  <span>that stung their eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once she finished, Cameron saw that she’d drawn a few gemmes. She pointed at the real ones around Cameron’s neck and made her questioning gesture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gemmes?” Cameron asked. “Well, gemmes are…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good?” Avery asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘Good’? Did you say ‘good’? Yes, gemmes are good. They heal us, protect us. They help us when we’re lost or scared.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gemmes…help…Cameron?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Giddy, Cameron took Avery’s quill and grew a big smiley face next to her gemme drawing. They took turns scribbling silly doodles around it, though Cameron’s couldn’t compare to Avery’s talent. While shaky, her love of drawing shone through the pages.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They spent nearly a half hour drawing gemmes and smiley faces. After they filled up two pages, Avery wrote out her alphabet in near perfect handwriting. She tried her best to teach Cameron her language, but “TVs,” “cities,” and “laptops” didn’t and would never register with Cameron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re like—” Avery pretended to fiddle with something in her lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it an object, or something like magic, like an idea you summon with your heart?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery pressed her mouth in a thin line, thinking hard. While she thought, Cameron thumbed through her book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They saw something, though. Right before Avery pulled it away, they saw a familiar face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was that me?” Cameron asked. “Did you draw me on that page?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery pressed the book against her chest. “Not good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/5b3b5e3fc76098ccc74e9294a34379ff/tumblr_pd097cEbtm1qmqh98o1_r1_1280.png" alt="" width="640" height="396" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1960808031" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not good? What’s not good?” Inching the book out of Avery’s hands, Cameron flipped back to the page and admired themselves in her style. Their eyes looked too big and their hair had a lot of detail in it, but it was undoubtedly them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This’s really good,” they said. “Can you draw me again? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Draw me</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” they tried in English.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery laughed at nothing and yanked down her hat. “Eye,” she then said, averting the questions and pointing to her own eyeball. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Being a lot easier to explain, Cameron searched for a nearby rock and readied their theatrical performance. They indicated that, in this story, they were smaller, about eleven. They pretended to carve out some rocks on their hands and knees, improperly digging without the equipment they had now. They made a note to look up cautiously at the Centrum ceiling as if it’d collapse on them. Unable to change fate, Cameron let the rock fall gently against their forehead and eye socket. They faked a head pain and gave a few moans to end their retelling about how they started their first cave-in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery, jaw dropped, clapped her hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron played off of her energy with a hammy bow. “I got these from the collapse, too.” They showed off their calf scar and the skin which had been etched away by the Earth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery pulled her legs to her chest, admiring Cameron’s body. Before Cameron got too flustered by that idea, Avery took off her yellow boot and two layers of socks to reveal her naked foot. A scar similar to Cameron’s cut white and pink against her shaven leg.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How?” Cameron asked, and made the question gesture they’d been using.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thinking about how to say it, Avery took her notebook and made it into a V shape. Then she pretended that her fingers were a walking person, carefully yet carelessly walking towards the edge. She made a quiet outcry, and the finger person tripped and fell into the V, landing wrong between their drawings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You fell?” Cameron asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery tightened her shoulders as if trapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You got stuck?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“S…Stuck?” Avery asked. “Yeah, stuck. Two—” And she said something that sounded like “hours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron understood. With the way she dressed and with her pack filled with instruments, Avery looked able to walk the woods by herself, but Cameron only trusted Arkęh:nen to safely go in and out of tunnles, Earth’s unforgiving zones.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two small children who lived in the northern dens crept into the Centrum. They took cover behind pillow forts and the pillars, trying to get closer to Avery without her noticing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She did. Halfway from where they started, Avery caught the children a second after Cameron had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Catching the Autrean’s eyes, the two children yelped and ran away. From either the way they waddled away or how hard they screamed, Avery burst into laughter. When one of them tripped and fell flat on the face into a bushel of blankets, Avery heaved over and choked on her giggles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron laughed along with her. Ever since meeting her, they’d feared she didn’t like showing too much happiness to other people. Seeing her shiny white teeth and the tears collect in the corners of her black eyes made Cameron want to keep laughing just so she kept laughing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then Cameron’s body shut down. A burning charred up their lungs and scratched their throat. Their shoulders numbed. Their arms went cold. They coughed to get something out, but nothing but spit came out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cameron?” Crawling over their drawings, Avery touched Cameron’s back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m okay,” Cameron wheezed. “This’s normal. It’ll go away soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No…Normal? No, no normal.” Avery wrestled with her pack’s front pocket and pulled out a small, orange bottle with a white top. She put that back immediately, not what she was looking for. Then she pulled out another bottle and shook out two blue rocks. She pointed to her mouth, indicating that Cameron should eat them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron finished coughing into the crook of their arm. “You can’t eat rocks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery read the label on the bottle, then offered it to Cameron again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again, Cameron pushed them away. “I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A crackle rustled in Avery’s bag. Still holding the bottle, Avery unzipped another zipper and took out the crackling box Cameron had seen in the Grandmoeders’ Den.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Moeder,” Avery said. She started packing away her quills and notebooks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Moeder what?” Cameron asked. “Are you already leaving? You just got here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh…” She tried a few words, none of which Cameron understood. She thought about it some more, eyes darting from side to side, then pretended to ring something in her hand. She made the exact sound the bell made whenever a Grandmoeder wished to speak with you.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A bell? Was your Moeder talking to you just now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Moeder, bell, yes.” She tied her shoe back on her foot and stood up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sensing that she needed to leave right away, Cameron escorted Avery back through the Main Exit Tunnle. She walked much more confidently than she had a few days ago. Cameron had only lit a few firebugs and, when they reached the end, Avery had only hit her head once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery played with her backpack straps, staring at the ground between her shoes and Cameron’s slippers. Cameron’s firebugs flitted around with their light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In a defeated tone, Avery said something akin to “goodbye” or “farewell.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cameron tried copying her accent with little success, then said in Arkęh:nen, “I hope your Moeder lets you come down more often.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Avery said, though Cameron didn’t know if she’d actually understood them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avery took a step forwards, and Cameron couldn’t help but do the same. It felt odd, but the two gave each other a quick hug before Avery ascended back up to the surface world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Cameron waved goodbye, something cool dripped down their chin. Careful so as not to stain their shirt, they wiped it up with their finger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Red spit smeared against their thumb.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Licking it back up, Cameron returned to the comforts of Arkęh:na.</span>

</p><p>Avery waited in the gym hallway for her mother to pull up in the parking lot. Around her, students K–12 filled the halls with chatter and scuffling. Sport teams and afterschool clubs divvied up into their social cliques as the masses filed into lines for the buses. Avery had told her mother right after lunch that, due to nerves, she wanted to be picked up and not risk her anxiety rising during the half-hour bus ride. She had yet to spot her mother’s car between the yellow buses.</p><p>To keep her mind off the everpresent school filling her senses, Avery opened up her notebook. She’d printed out dozens of pictures of the forest and of her parents to show Cameron, but she hadn’t expected Cameron to see her <em> drawings </em> . And the drawing of <em> them </em>specifically. She’d caught herself doodling them in class, but they were doodles, not finished illustrations. She had to do better next time they met up.</p><p>Still, she smiled at herself as she admired Cameron’s doodles. The shaky lines held the flair of a kid who spent most of their free time in caves, their fingers browned by soaking them in the Earth for too long. She even spotted excess dirt dirtying the page. Avery had secretly hoped Cameron would draw her, but it never happened. Just gemmes and smiling faces.</p><p>So far, Avery hadn’t told anyone about Cameron or Arkęh:na. She had no reason to tell her teachers and her parents would never believe her. Her parents didn’t even know she caved as deeply as she did. She wouldn’t put it past them to forget about “Arkęh:na” entirely and just ban Avery from the forest while the authorities arrested 300-odd people for living illegally on state ground.</p><p>No, she’d never tell them. Not being able to judge their reaction made her bury down the secret even deeper than Arkęh:na itself.</p><p>After all the buses left and the hall became less sporadic, Avery looked up to see her mother’s car waiting impatiently near the curb. She had her phone to her ear, likely about to call Avery to tell her to turn around. As Avery guessed, her phone rang a second later.</p><p>“I’m coming,” she said, and hung up.</p><p>Her mother’s car interior contradicted her messy computer workspace. She vacuumed it every night, so the black floor mats were kept immaculate, free of crumbs and receipts. Whenever Avery entered into the backseat, her mother watched her to make sure she didn’t track anything into the car.</p><p>“How was school?” she asked in an automatic manner. “Why’d you have me pick you up?”</p><p>“Just overwhelmed.”</p><p>“About?”</p><p>“Nothing much.”</p><p>Knowing she’d never get anything more out of Avery, Avery’s mother turned out of the parking lot into the town of Foxfield.</p><p>Foxfield’s Main Street consisted of two gas stations, a supermarket, a post office, and two churches that must’ve been built in the 1800s. Town Hall reminded Avery of what pilgrims flocked to to discuss the Constitution. The houses even more so, with their white pillars and multiple fireplaces. Avery and her family lived about thirty minutes away from it all, architects of their own outcasting.</p><p>“Right after you texted me, I got a call from your grandmother,” Avery’s mother said. “Your grandfather’s not doing well. He collapsed again while trying to clean the stairs. He’s in bed now, resting, but your grandmother’s trying to take care of the store by herself.”</p><p>“Grandma <em> can </em>take care of the store by herself,” Avery said, remembering all the triumphant speeches her grandmother had given her about running her own store.</p><p>“Not at her age, not anymore. I wanted your father to go check on them, but he’s out working in the field, and then you called. I’m planning on staying there for a few hours. Do you have any homework to do?”</p><p>“Not a lot. Can you drop me off—”</p><p>“No. No more hiking. You’ve never hiked this much before. Your grandmother needs us.”</p><p>Thinking about how much Cameron would’ve wanted to help <em> their </em> Grandmoeders, Avery conceded and planned to visit Arkęh:na another day. Not that she didn’t care about her grandfather. Whenever they came to see him after he collapsed, he always told them to go back home, to the point where he almost yelled at them. He <em> was </em>going deaf, but Avery didn’t want to stress them out with worry they felt wasn’t justified.</p><p>Avery’s mother drove through Foxfield’s pastures and farmland with lax movements. The forest towered over them on the left while cows and horses grazed on the right. Avery had always wanted to try their fresh produce, but her mother didn’t trust the farm owners. Unless Avery went to her grandparents’ store, she couldn’t try what Foxfield had to offer.</p><p>Avery’s mother went to turn left to head, then slammed so hard on her brakes that Avery’s head flung forwards, her back jumping off the seat. Her mother’s cane, which she’d hooked on the front seat, clattered between the seat and door with the force of the car’s sudden stop.</p><p>Someone had turned quicker than Avery’s mother had and sped away just as fast. Avery’s mother, panting, cursed them out and went to grab her cane.</p><p>“The light’s green,” Avery warned her.</p><p>“I know,” she said, and left her cane be to make the turn.</p><p>Avery studied the tip of her mother’s wooden cane. She’d seen a few Arkęh:nen use canes to walk around. Some of them had bandages over certain parts of their body, but most of them looked young, like Avery’s age.</p><p>“Hey, Mom?” Avery asked. “What’s it like being hurt all the time?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean with your cane, and how you’re not going to get better.”</p><p>“You mean being disabled?”</p><p>“I think.”</p><p>Her mother tightened her grip on the steering wheel as she road into the forest. “Do you think your Lyme Disease is getting worse?”</p><p>“No. I’m still taking my medication every morning with my breakfast.” Avery patted the front pocket of her bag to make sure she still had both the antibiotics and her regular headache medication. When Cameron had ruptured into that coughing fit, Avery had almost given the former to them. “I’m just curious about how it feels. I’ve…been talking with somebody, at school, who might’ve been born with something bad in them.”</p><p>“So you’re talking about a chronic illness. A chronic illness is a sickness that lasts months and months, like cancer or asthma. It can sometimes be cured or lessened with treatment and self-care, but normally it stays with you. A <em> terminal </em>illness is usually a quicker sickness that typically results in death.”</p><p>Avery slid into the backseat, intimidated by how much her mother knew. “I think they have a chronic illness.”</p><p>“Well, it’s…difficult, to say the least.”</p><p>“Does it always hurt?”</p><p>“More or less. You just have to deal with it. Some people can’t. If I hadn’t been wearing my seatbelt when I got into that car accident years ago, I would’ve gone straight through the window and lost more than just my leg strength. That bear or moose—whatever I hit—sent me straight through the guardrail and down a ditch.”</p><p>“They never found what you hit?” Avery asked. “What if it was a person?”</p><p>“Your grandparents said they’d found a dead deer a mile from where the crash happened. They think I hit that. It was too dark for me to see.”</p><p>Avery watched the blur of green and brown fly by. “So how would I go around talking about my friend’s sickness?”</p><p>“Well, what sickness does she have?”</p><p><em> She. </em> Even though she didn’t understand it herself, Avery respected how Cameron chose to identify, but she didn’t have the courage to correct her mother. Not wanting to upset her, Avery said, “I’m not sure yet. They…She coughs a lot, but I think it’s normal. She’s also really frail and pale.”</p><p>“Does she take medication for anything?”</p><p>“No, I don’t think so. They’re really religious, I think. They’re like a Wiccan.”</p><p>“Her family’s <em> Wiccan </em>?” Avery’s mother asked. “Avery, don’t hang out with Wiccans, especially if they’re sick. You know how easily you catch other’s illnesses.”</p><p>“But what if they’re getting sick based on the environment they’re in, like their house is moldy or the air in it is bad?”</p><p>“Avery, you can only do so much for this girl. Not everyone can pick up their house and move to someplace better.”</p><p>“You and Dad did when Grandma and Grandpa set up shop here.”</p><p>Avery’s mother caught her daughter’s eye in the rearview mirror. “If you’re so worried about her, convince her parents to do something about it. You can only do so much for someone who doesn’t want to change.”</p><p>Avery smiled bleakly at the thought of her trying to convince Cameron’s Moeder or even their Grandmoeder to move out of a place they’d been living in for more than 300 years. Hopefully Cameron would understand her before the worst happened. Spending so much time in those tunnels couldn’t have been healthy.</p><p>“Here we are,” Avery’s mother announced, pulling into the rocky parking lot.</p><p>Her grandmother’s and grandfather’s mom and pop shop was trapped in a snow globe of autumn decor from the 80s. Everything smelled so much of artificial cinnamon that Avery fully believed the floorboards were just flattened cinnamon sticks.</p><p>Giant cardboard cutouts of hand-drawn apples welcomed them at the front door. Real apples, pumpkins, and pears sat next to apple, pumpkin, and pear candles. Cartoon milk jugs and orange juices chilled above the refrigerators, and cheesy knickknacks of bears and bald eagles collected dust on tables decorated with maple leaves.</p><p>Avery’s grandmother, Sun, swiveled on her swivel stool behind the front counter. Her crochet needles poked out of whatever scarf or blanket she was currently knitting.</p><p>“Where’s Ash?” Avery’s mother asked. “Is he resting? How is he?”</p><p>“He’s fine,” Avery’s grandmother said, “though he called down saying he walked into our closet and didn’t like what he saw. Said he was going to try and rearrange the summer and winter clothes before dinner.”</p><p>“What do you mean? He should be resting. Didn’t you say he fell?”</p><p>Ignoring her worries, Avery’s grandmother beckoned Avery over and kissed her cheek. “How’re you doing, baby?”</p><p>“Grandpa’s still alive, right?”</p><p>“Of course he is, but since you’re all so worried, let’s go up and see him. I told you, Juniper, there’s nothing to worry about. Old people fall all the time.”</p><p>“You have to worry when old people fall. I’m telling you, I found this nice retirement home—”</p><p>“Marlows don’t go into retirement,” Avery’s grandmother said. “We work until we die, and then our granddaughters take up the family business.”</p><p>“I’m not good at talking with people,” Avery reminded her.</p><p>“You haven’t learned anything from your mother. Juniper, baby, come up with us. I wanted to talk to you about that paper you’re writing for your job. Ash is worried about this mountain your husband’s demolitioning.”</p><p>Avery darted up the staircase before her mother and grandmother got there. She never minded waited behind them as they plodded up the steps, but her mother would yell at her to go up first, and her grandmother would always shuffle a little quicker up the stairs whenever Avery waited behind her. That Marlow stubbornness had never reached Avery’s bloodline.</p><p>Avery’s grandfather sat upright in bed underneath a single quilt. Three of their four pillows held his head upright so he could watch television with ease.</p><p>To combat the television’s volume, he shouted, “Hey, Avery, girl. I didn’t know you were coming down to say hello.”</p><p>“Hi, Grandpa.” Avery bent down to withstand one of her grandfather’s surprisingly strong hugs.</p><p>“How’re you doing? How’s that girlfriend of yours? Is she still giving you trouble?”</p><p>Avery blew out her cheek in surprise. She’d told him several times not to use that phrasing. She didn’t want to say something she didn’t mean, or she didn’t want to tell them about it just yet. Her fight with Bridget still stung in her eyes.</p><p>“Sun said you fell,” Avery’s mother said, pulling up a chair. “You shouldn’t be working the shop when you’re this fragile. You should be settling down.”</p><p>Avery’s grandmother readied her husband’s medication and handed it to him with a glass of water. “He’s fine.”</p><p>“He’s not fine. You need to be relocated to a retirement home. You can’t keep taking these stairs.”</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about this right now,” Avery’s grandfather said in a harrumph. “Avery, tell me about school. You’re almost a high schooler now. Do you like your classes?”</p><p>“I don’t have a lot of classes with Bridget, so we’ve drifted apart, “Avery half-truthed, “but I did meet someone new.”</p><p>“Meet?”</p><p>“Not like that,” Avery corrected. “They’re just a friend. Their name’s Cameron. They’re, uh, a foreign exchange student from…” She couldn’t think of a country that didn’t sound outlandish, so she blurted out, “They’re from England.”</p><p>“A Brit?” Avery’s grandmother said. “I bet she has a cool accent.”</p><p>Avery wanted so badly to correct them, but she held herself back. She hardly understood it; the older generations would just make fun of her. “They’re into rocks and gemstones and stuff like that. We draw together.”</p><p>“She’s Wiccan, I’ve heard,” Avery’s mother said, arms crossed around her cane. “Magic and ghosts and the like.”</p><p>“Well, that just makes her more interesting, doesn’t it?” Avery’s grandmother said. “Does she cast spells on you?”</p><p>Avery chuckled, then seriously considered Cameron owning a wand. They’d be into healing magic, for sure.</p><p>“Oh, Avery, I found some more sweaters for you to try on,” her grandfather said.</p><p>“No more sweaters, she already has so many,” her mother said. “Half of her closet is sweaters, and most of them are from you.”</p><p>“I don’t mind,” Avery said. When her grandparents weren’t busy running their shop downstairs, they somehow magically produced their own brands of clothes. However they did it, wherever they found the time, news outfits, hats, and socks suddenly appeared in their closet, most of which teleported up the hill to Avery. The thickness of the material kept ticks from eating her alive.</p><p>“They’re on the stool,” her grandfather shouted.</p><p>“I got them,” Avery called back, and flipped through the gaudy designs. They felt as soft as the bear pelt in Cameron’s den.</p><p>She paused. She hadn’t seen any closets in the Arkęh:nen dens.</p><p>Coming out with a mountain of sweaters and jackets, Avery ran around the corner and said, “Do you have any more you don’t want?”</p><p>“Why?” Avery’s mother asked.</p><p>“I want to donate them.”</p><p> </p><p>──✧──</p><p> </p><p>Escaping the house proved easy when Avery only had to evade her mother. Sometimes she’d run into the forest, hang out for an hour in the trees, and come back without her mother noticing. Sometimes she’d get a scolding, but it amazed her how invested her mother got with her work.</p><p>When they got home and Avery’s mother went to her working space, Avery took one of her boxes of clothes up to her room. When she came back down, she had her school backpack stuffed not with school supplies but with as many sweaters as the zippers could handle. Adjusting the weight on her back, she casually climbed back down to the first floor and headed for the garage. “I’m gonna walk Oreo and Pumpkin for a bit. They looked antsy when we pulled up.”</p><p>Her mother checked the time on her computer. “Be back in a half hour, okay? Your father’s coming home late.”</p><p>“Okay. See you.”</p><p>“See you.”</p><p>Even though she was in the clear, Avery quietly shut the garage door so it wouldn’t creak and settled her dogs so they didn’t bark.</p><p>After she leashed her dogs, Avery opened her mother’s trunk and heaved out the other box of clothes. These could clothe at least five Arkęh:nen families with these.</p><p>Getting to Arkęh:na with a full backpack, a heavy box, and her two dogs tested her coordination. She knew she wouldn’t lose her determination, but maybe next time she’d bring a wheelbarrow. She knew they had so much junk in their attic, junk that could help a whole bunch of Arkęh:nen. Boxes, old mattresses—how would she smuggle a mattress up these hills? Maybe she could ask some of those “scavengers” for help, the hunters allowed to leave the caves.</p><p>When she got to the Main Exit Cave, she tied Pumpkin and Oreo to a nearby tree. Neither of them trusted the cave anymore after it’d swallowed Avery whole.</p><p>“You’ll trust it soon enough,” Avery told them as she moved the rock out of the way. “Trust me, it’s kind of fun down here.”</p><p>She’d gotten used to falling into Cameron’s place. She now used the wood and stone that jutted from the wall as a ladder. It got her dirty, but her parents wouldn’t bat an eye at their daughter’s muddy, dirty clothes.</p><p>Not many Arkęh:nen welcomed her to their Community as flamboyantly as they’d done a few days ago. Some turned their heads and some children hid behind their parents, but the Community had accepted her, or didn’t mind her as much.</p><p>But Cameron hadn’t come for her. Usually they heard her coming down and would take her in before somebody else did. She’d gone to their den once, but she’d passed dozens of similar-sized holes and had forgotten which level Cameron lived on.</p><p>Taking a chance, Avery shimmied towards the ville and stuck her nose in one of the open shoppes. The shopkeep had a monocle in one eye and his hair braided down his back. He was laughing wheezily at someone in the next shoppe.</p><p>“E-Excuse me,” Avery whispered. “I’m looking for Cameron?”</p><p>The man said something in astonishment, then checked the inside of Avery’s box, holding his monocle so it didn’t fall out.</p><p>“Uh, Cameron?”</p><p>“<em> Cameron </em>?” he asked, then asked something else too fast for Avery to interpret. Their language reminded her of an English dialect lost by time.</p><p>“<em> Okay </em>,” the old man finally said, and left their tent to show Avery the way.</p><p>The underground layer to Arkęh:na appeared just as magnificent as the layer above: three compact layers connected by ladders and rickety corridors. Some older teenagers hung outside of their homes, taking care of little kids and making sure they didn’t fall off the ledges. One group stared down at Avery and her escort. Avery dipped her head to hide her eyes from them, but the old man stopped, making Avery smack into him.</p><p>Cameron was inside their den, sleeping inside their bundle of quilts.</p><p>The old man gave Avery a pat before he headed back to his shoppe, leaving Avery in Cameron’s doorway.</p><p>Avery inched through the misshapen hole. She took in the dozens, maybe hundreds of “gemmes” Cameron had collected over the years. Some reached two feet tall and shined without the help of the lanterns outside. Cameron’s bat Nuvu, who was hanging on the metal grate attached to Cameron’s wall, had one in her mouth, nibbling on it like rock candy.</p><p>Cameron inhaled and smacked their head against the stone around them. They stammered in Arkęh:nen like they’d awoken from a bad dream and jabbed out their hand to retrieve a gemme near their feet.</p><p>“I’m sorry!” Avery said. “I just came in. I didn’t know you’d be sleeping.”</p><p>Cleaning their eyes of eye crust, Cameron shook their head, dismissing Avery. Then they addressed the box with a question. “What?” they asked. “What is?”</p><p>“Clothes,” Avery said. “My Grandmoeder and Grandfader made them and was going to give it to me”—she pointed at herself—“but I don’t need them, so I wanted to give them to you.” She pointed at Cameron.</p><p>Cameron coughed a raspy cough and inspected Avery’s presents. Thankfully, they were wearing their strange skin-tight suit, so Avery didn’t have to cover her eyes that much. “Me?” they asked, hanging the sweater over their torso for size comparison.</p><p>“Yeah, for you. For Cameron.”</p><p>“Wow.” Cameron climbed out of their bed and hugged Avery. “Thank you,” it sounded like they said.</p><p>“You’re welcome. I was looking at some of these and think that you’d look nice in—”</p><p>Cameron took the box and struggled to lift it with both arms. Before Avery could help them, they left with the box and turned down the hall.</p><p>“Cameron?” Avery asked. She went to ask them what they were doing, then figured out their intent.</p><p>Dropping the box at their feet, Cameron took to handing out all of Avery’s grandparent’s clothes to their neighbors. Parents from across the walkway came over with hesitancy, nervous about what Avery had to give them, but Cameron made sure that they—everyone but them—had new clothes to wear until the box had been emptied.</p>

  <p>Avery bit her jerky in half as she enticed her dogs into the formidable cave. Pumpkin had the right to be wary and kept hidden behind a dead tree. Oreo, though, kept his nose to the ground as he shuffled in place.</p><p>“It won’t be scary,” Avery promised them. “It’s just a short climb down.”</p><p>Pumpkin rubbed her face with her paw.</p><p>“Pumpkin, the stairs to my room are steeper than this.” She wanted to bring up multiple points to try to persuade her dogs to enter Arkęh:na, but she wasn’t alone in her room. She knew scavengers and other Arkęh:nen might’ve been listening to her, realizing that she conversed with her dogs as if they were humans.</p><p>When Oreo finally crept into the mouth of the cave, Avery rewarded him with a full piece of jerky. Either from hearing Oreo scarf it down or finding herself alone, Pumpkin snuck around the corner of the cave.</p><p>“You don’t have to stay that long,” she told them, “just try it. You’ll have to meet Cameron sooner or later. I’d consider them a…” She gave herself pause. It took a sleepover over Bridget’s house and a movie date before Avery had the courage to call her a “friend.” She couldn’t recall when “friend” had become “best friend” and when “best friend” had become something more, but she remembered vividly when they’d become “strangers,” when Avery had become “weird.”</p><p>Disheartened by that piercing memory, Avery pushed over the rock and pulled out more jerky to tempt her dogs down the slope.</p><p>Pumpkin shoved her snout into the airy darkness. Her tail, once between her legs, slapped against Avery’s backpack in excitement. No sooner had Avery notice Pumpkin’s change in personality than Pumpkin lost it and bolted down the slope. She ate it a few times and rolled on her side, but she recovered swiftly and reached the bottom on all fours.</p><p>Tied to Pumpkin at the hip, Oreo barked and followed her path, albeit with more grace and control.</p><p>“Wait!” Avery skipped a few rings of the wooden ladder and climbed down to catch them, but Pumpkin had found her feet. With Oreo not far behind, the two sprinted down the Main Exit Tunnle much more confidently than Avery had done when she discovered this underground world.</p><p>With worry sweating down her back, Avery shone her phone down the tunnle and called out to them. “Pumpkin, Oreo, wait! Come back!”</p><p>Pumpkin and Oreo transformed into royal guests in front of the people of Arkęh:na. Every idle Arkęh:nen locked their eyes on them, their mouths sagging. They dropped everything in their hands and stopped talking just to watch the two of them make their presence known. The way their eyes shined told Avery that these people had never seen a dog before, at least not an alive one.</p><p>But then the first shriek echoed through the Centrum, and then it multiplied. Arkęh:nen scattered. Some fell back on their butts as Avery’s dogs neared them. When someone pulled out something akin to a stick or a knife, Avery picked up her pace and snatched up Oreo’s collar. He hopped into the air like a horse, ready to meet hundreds of new friends.</p><p>“Come on!” Avery pleaded. “Knock it off!”</p><p>A dozen new screams slammed into Avery at once. They sounded young and hurt as if one of Avery’s dogs had bitten them. Avery knew it couldn’t have happened, but their crying still sounded horrified.</p><p>A gaggle of nervous children ran away from Pumpkin wagging her butt at them, and Cameron, wearing a strange poncho, stood petrified between them. They had a long staff in their hand with gemmes embedded into the wood. It looked like they’d been talking to the group of children before Avery’s dogs interrupted whatever they were doing.</p><p>Lowering their staff, Cameron tripped on their poncho before running away.</p><p>

</p><p>“No, it’s alright!” Avery said in English, then fought with her brain to say it in Arkęh:nen. She’d written down tips and tricks about the language in her sketchbook, but speaking it under her breath and actually implementing it took two different sides of her brain to use. “<em>No…it’s good.</em>”</p><p>“<em>No!</em>” Cameron yelped. “<em>It’s bad!</em>”</p><p>Following the line of screaming children, Cameron running away in an extravagant fashion, and her barking dogs, Avery gave chase and hoped not too many people thought bad of her when she stopped.</p><p>Cameron and the little children led her into that strange building she’d seen next to the tunnle to the Grandmoeders’ Den. It was the tallest structure in Arkęh:na, about a floor and a half high, with multiple holes acting as windows for a bird’s eye view of the village. Children safe from the barking poked their heads out of the holes, calling out to Avery.</p><p>“<em>Autre, Autre!</em>” they kept chanting, but Avery didn’t know if they meant in an admiring or taunting manner.</p><p>She also didn’t know how a building made of rock and clay with no papers or pencils in it reminded her so much of a school. A bundle of bags and shoes were thrown into one corner of the hallway, somewhat organized yet catastrophically childlike with how few shoes were correctly matched with one another. Drawings of people and faces had been etched into the walls and colored with dyes. The families of stick figures and angry bears resembled cave drawings from prehistory, but they also leveled Cameron’s artistic skill.</p><p>Avery couldn’t dote on them for long and raced to where Cameron and the children had run towards. They’d barricaded themselves in a room at the end of the hall, but without doors, they had only a curtain separating themselves from Avery’s dogs. Knowing not even a staircase could halt Pumpin’s and Oreo’s innate curiosities, they bolted straight through.</p><p>The classroom-like room had boulders organized in a wide circle, shaven down so one could sit on them easily. In the center stood a larger, smoother boulder, likely where the teacher would sit and teach.</p><p>Maywood was sitting on the teacher boulder while Basil protected the children and Cameron with his arms. He shouted at Oreo and Pumpkin to get back.</p><p>“Don’t hurt them!” Avery grabbed her dogs’ collars and battled their strengths. “They don’t bite, they just get excited when they meet new people.”</p><p>“You craze!” Basil snapped in English. He, like Cameron and also Maywood, had on a lavish outfit that looked more like a costume rather than efficient caving clothes. “Stop them now! They’re loud!”</p><p>Avery pet her dogs into quiet submission. Oreo kept his snout relatively shut while Pumpkin whined for someone to acknowledge her. “I’m sorry. They usually control themselves.”</p><p>“<em>What is?</em>” Cameron asked, covering their eyes with both hands.</p><p>“They’re dogs. They’re pets, like Nuvu to you.”</p><p>Basil tried translating for everyone. He never took his eyes off the dogs, and nothing he seemed to say made the children any less scared.</p><p>“Here. Look.” Avery cooed for Oreo to give her his paw. It’d been an old trick she’d taught him as a baby, but even with so much happening around them, Oreo gave her his paw twice. “They won’t hurt you. They’re good.”</p><p>“Why you bring the animals here?” Basil asked. “Animals do not come here.”</p><p>“I just thought it’d be fun. I didn’t think they’d act out and run away from me.” She lowered her head in shame. She’d thought she’d acclimated nicely to Arkęh:na. Now she felt like an unwelcome outsider all over again, unwanted by those she thought she could trust.</p><p>Sneaking up between Basil and the children, Cameron slunk over to Pumpkin on their hands in knees with an outstretched hand. Avery saw them shaking, but they fought through the fear to pet Pumpkin on her head.</p><p>Overcome by her own excitedness, Pumpkin lurched forwards and dropped Cameron on their back. She devoured them with love, wetting their face with sticky, slobbery kisses. One paw to Cameron’s gut made them gasp, but other than that, Pumpkin didn’t hurt them.</p><p>After seeing that Avery’s actions held no ill will, a few of the braver children broke from Basil’s security and touched the dogs. They squealed and hid their hands behind their backs, keeping watch of Avery for consent that this was okay. Soon every one of them gave a full pat on each dogs’ head. It relieved everyone except for Basil.</p><p>“<em>Why…for…this?</em>” one child asked Avery. Avery had only caught those three words, so she waited and smiled at Basil for help.</p><p>Basil curled his upper lip at her as he helped his sister off the boulder and onto her cane. It looked like Maywood wanted to pet one of the dogs herself, but Basil kept her back.</p><p>“<em>Basil, it’s fine</em>,” she said.</p><p>“<em>No</em>.”</p><p>“She can pet them if she wants,” Avery told Basil. “They won’t hurt you.”</p><p>Maywood whispered something sternly at Basil before she pet Oreo around the collar. Going against his request, Basil said what sounded like a swore and walked himself into the corner to cool off.</p><p>Cameron spat out a mouthful of Pumpkin’s fur and wiped themselves of slobber. “<em>Names</em>?” they asked.</p><p>“This one is Pumpkin and this one is Oreo,” Avery said, and the children began repeating their names in broken English.</p><p>“<em>Oy-ro!</em>”</p><p>“<em>Poomp-king!</em>”</p><p>Avery smiled as she lent Cameron her hand. They took it while also using their staff to keep them balanced.</p><p>“<em>What’re you doing here</em>?” Avery asked, testing her Arkęh:nen. “<em>Why’re you here</em>?”</p><p>“<em>It’s a school</em>,” Cameron said, and addressed the herd of hip-high children. “<em>We learn things here. It’s Children of the Kinder Day.” </em></p><p>“Children…of the Kinder Day?” she translated, and made a questioning gesture.</p><p>Without Basil’s stubborn help, Cameron thought with their staff poised underneath their chin. Their spare hand found their way into a nearby child’s hair. “A day for the children,” they reworded in English. “Love children. A day for them.”</p><p>“Like a Children Appreciation Day?” Avery asked. “You’re English was good just then, by the way.”</p><p>“Good English?” Cameron asked. “I try. Basil, come here.”</p><p>Begrudgingly, Basil came over. “We celebrate the happiness of children,” he explained. “Us teach them the history and joys of Arkęh:na and Arkęh:nen life. You ruin it with these creatures. I hate them. Furry bears.”</p><p>“Well, Pumpkin and Oreo are close to me, so I thought Cameron meeting them would be…nice.”</p><p>Basil rolled his eyes in annoyance, yet explained the situation to everyone in the room.</p><p>With a proper explanation, Maywood smiled and played with Oreo’s neck fur. “<em>Cute babies</em>,” she said. “<em>I like them</em>.”</p><p>“<em>I like this one</em>,” Cameron said, pointing to Pumpkin. “<em>Cute colors. Avery is cute</em>.”</p><p>Avery’s chest went cold with dread. “<em>Huh</em>?”</p><p>“<em>Avery’s animals are cute. Avery’s animals</em>.”</p><p>“Oh.” She breathed forcefully through her nose. How had Cameron learned that word? Why had they said it in that way? Had Basil taught it to them to make a fool out of Avery? Was he really that mean?</p><p>“Oh, Avery. Help. Come here. Big.” Cameron pointed to their classroom ceiling, then waved their hand above their head, indicating a notable size difference.</p><p>Basil snapped upright and said something to Cameron.</p><p>“Avery is big,” Cameron said.</p><p>Basil said something back.</p><p>“Tall,” they then said, correcting themselves. “Avery is tall.”</p><p>“But I’m tall, too! I’m taller than she is, and I said I’d do it.”</p><p>“No. Avery here. Avery help.”</p><p>When Cameron started climbing on top of a desk-like boulder, both Avery and Basil ran to catch them in case they fell.</p><p>“What’re they doing?” Avery asked Basil.</p><p>“Supplies are stored in the ceiling for history lessons, but you do not have to get it. <em> Cameron, come down. I can get it. You’ll hurt yourself</em>.”</p><p>“<em>You didn’t get it when I asked you to, so I’ll let Avery get them</em>.”</p><p>“<em>Please be careful</em>,” Maywood told everyone, huddling the children around her like a real teacher.</p><p>Avery didn’t care which of them helped get the supplies down and went to tell them that in their own language, but she lost all train of thought in both English and Arkęh:nen.</p><p>At this angle, looking up at Cameron, Avery saw underneath their flowy poncho. They were wearing their tight bodysuit, but still, she’d never seen this literal side of them before. The curve of their lower back, the shape of their upper thighs…</p><p>Gulping, Avery leaned down to see more.</p><p>Basil slapped her in the arm, knocking her away from such thoughts and causing her to wince in pain.</p><p>“<em>Basil</em>!” Maywood said in astonishment.</p><p>“Why did you just do that?” Basil demanded, looking aghast and disgusted with what Avery had done.</p><p>“I-I didn’t do anything,” Avery lied.</p><p>“I saw you. You look at them.”</p><p>“What?” Cameron asked.</p><p>Avery’s mind and feelings slipped down a mental slope, struggling to keep her from tumbling down. Struggling, she said, “Uh, nothing. Basil, he hit a bug off me. Right?”</p><p>Basil kept his eyes on her like always, reevaluating her in a tarnished light. Then he slowly dropped his hand and wiped it off as if to clean himself of something filthy. “It was a bug,” he muttered. “I kill it.”</p><p>“<em>Don’t touch her, Basil</em>,” Cameron said, unaware of what just occurred. “Avery, please help?”</p><p>Avery stepped away, hiding her now shaking hands behind her. Her shameful head couldn’t have sunk any lower. She’d controlled this side of herself up until now, but sometimes this unsightly side came out without warning.</p><p>“Avery?”</p><p>“I’m okay,” she lied, and let Basil take on the job Cameron had wanted her to do.</p><p>Maywood, unable to speak English, came over with her cane and her group of doting children. She touched the middle of Avery’s back like a mother, reassuring her about something, but nothing she could’ve said could’ve eased what Avery was overthinking.</p>
