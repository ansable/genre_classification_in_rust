  <b> <em>LOADInG MEMORY….̴.̶ ,̶.̷̞̇̒ .̸̢̛̙̚ ,̶̮̦̕  .. </em> </b>
</p><p>  … /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ scanned the hall, scanned the backs of the men in black who guarded her. The young android understood that this was a part of her training. Regardless, she hadn’t fathomed that her creators would send her to one of the most dangerous high-security prisons in all of Lagonis. Observing the pristine white walls around her, /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ concluded that such advanced security induced some equally advanced sanitation. Even more interesting than that were the machines patrolling the hallway. /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  was awed— was that the correct term?— by this unfamiliar environment, one so diametrically opposed to the home she was confined to.</p><p>  One of the men swerved to the right, bringing the group to a round gate operated by a keypad at its frame. The man scanned his eyeball, and the metal panels forming the gate spiraled open like a flower in bloom. /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ , mouth agape, tiptoed to view the room past the broad shoulders of her escorts. Alas, it was in vain.</p><p>  “In here, /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ , are the tenstrikers of Quaisor,” the man nearest to her said. The android, in response, marvelled. “Because of their status, they’re separated from the other prisoners. Tenstrikers are the dirt of the earth who give Lagonis a bad name. These are the very people you are designed to eliminate once you join Sodasai. You understand that, right?”</p><p>  Of course /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  understood. She heard these words from her creators many a time and oft, and she had no doub̷̹̝͗t̸̩̎,̷̢̝̓,̷͔̦̈́̇̕ ,̷̢̝̓,̷͔̦̳͕̻̣̈́̇̕h̷3̸r̷ ̸s̷!̵$̶̳̫͓̗̦̳̋̋̊̔͘s,..$̷̢̹́̄̿͗͋̉̈t̷͍͇͚͐̕3̶̢̹̇̕ŗ̴̗̎͐̌ ̵̲͗̈́͆͗͘Ȇ̶̪̭͓̏̀͌̏̕͝$̵9u̸,̷̢̝̓,̷͔̦̳͕̻̣̈́̇̕n̶….̸̖̓̿ͅ.̵̳̌̊,̸͉̜̌?̴̳̑͝?̴̻̑?̷͚̙̇.???<em> ? </em> ?(]] <em> {NOT FOUND} </em>. Her purpose was simple— spelled out for her carefully, in ample detail: as soon as she finished training, she would Emerge, and she would join the law-enforcement agency Sodasai as a soldier of the SOLJO Division, protecting the humans from dangerous tenstrikers.</p><p>  Without further ado, the men led her inside. They crossed a thin bridge with a tall glass window, separating them from the tenstrikers below. /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  peered down.</p><p>  Swarms of humans were down there. In this mess hall, /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  deduced, humans clad in white jumpsuits were gathered eating subpar meals decorated with complimentary holiday ribbons and desserts. “Today is a human holiday in this country,” one man explained, likely sensing /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ ‘s confusion. “The inmates get their own tiny celebration.”</p><p>  With no way to prove this, /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  accepted this explanation, and zoomed in with her Retina display. It was truly a spectacle. Some of the tenstrikers ate peacefully, others sobbed. Some were unconscious in the corner with styrofoam cups clutched in their hands, frothing at the rim. Others were not so quiet. Others raised hell. At these disturbances, one of the prison guards who was sentineled at /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ ‘s side walked towards a door at the end of the bridge, unlocked it, and flurried down the steps. She quickly apprehended the troublemakers in two swift blows.</p><p>  “Gods… not even the <em> Nomoday </em>spirit can do anything to change these guys’ hearts.” The man hovering behind /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  shook his head distastefully. “They’ll always be criminals.”</p><p>  <em> Criminals… </em>All of a sudden, one of the mess hall doors opened. Two guards were wrestling a man inside. He struggled, but the guards triumphed, shoving him past the double doors. The doors slammed shut, the guards behind it, and /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  heard the sound of a lock clanging.</p><p>  All eyes turned towards the newcomer. As /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  looked closer, she came to the conclusion that this was no man— he must have been a boy, at least, with dark brown hair and olive green eyes. Upon analyzing the expressions of the remaining inmates, /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  discovered that the emotions they displayed were either that of disgust, anger, indifference, or lust.</p><p>  “Who is that?” the android inquired, pointing at the boy. But the men surrounding her didn’t reply, as they either didn’t hear her or were ignoring her. /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ ‘s shoulders sank.</p><p>  The boy tried navigating his way around the crowd. He certainly didn’t appear happy to be here; /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  surmised he had just come from solitary confinement. As the boy attempted to reach the kitchen, he was shoved purposefully back. The shoves became more overt. He yelled expletives but could not surmount over the majority. A group of prisoners had him backed up against the wall. One of them reached for the hem of his pants, and another lifted a fist...</p><p>  /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  heard one of the men behind her swallow. “Hey…” He put his hand on /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ ‘s shoulder. “We should probably move on, /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ . There’s somewhere you—”</p><p>  “What are they doing to him?” she asked, eyes widening at the display.</p><p>  Another man grunted loudly. “We should leave.”</p><p>  “Is he in danger?” she persisted.</p><p>  “What a bunch of maggots…”</p><p>  “I swear to the gods this place is a fucking pigsty.”</p><p>  “I don’t want to be here anymore… Am I the only one wh—”</p><p>  Some instinct within /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  had her tearing away from the men and towards the bridge door. “Hey, where is she going?” one exclaimed. But they were too late, for she had already begun descending the staircase into the mess hall. She pushed past the prison guard and entered.</p><p>  The first thing that struck her was the stench. It was a powerful odor, one not quite distinguishable. The next thing that struck her was the noise. Then the sights. Then the feeling of bodies swelling all around her. There were so many things, so many sensations coming into her brain all at once. /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  felt the air thicken around her. She felt herself withdraw, slowly into herself, into the tumult of her mind. The discomfort was unbearable.</p><p>  /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  pushed herself through the crowd. The astonished prisoners parted for her, unsure of how to react to her presence. She pushed until she finally breached the wall of humans to enter into the fray. She broke free, inhaled the dense air, and found the teenager and his assailants.</p><p>  <em> You were made to protect humans. </em> /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  had repeated this in her head several times. She stood still, watched as the boy was beaten by a man and his accomplices stood back and watched. /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  examined her fingernails, clenched her fist. Her job was to protect humans.</p><p>  The man laughed. He inflicted many bruises on the boy already, and the victim wasn’t fighting back, at least couldn’t. Around them, prisoners looked away. Soon the leader of the pack drew away, and he was about to deliver a devastating blow. He raised his fist, leaned back...</p><p>  /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  interposed herself between the attacker and the boy. She threw her arms around the boy, heard the pounding of his heart as his chest became flush with her ear, and used her strength to set him down behind her. The fist intended for the boy met with /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ ‘s cheek. She felt no pain, even as the blow split open a bloodless cut on her face; the man did, as he cried out in pain. /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  spun around and she saw that the man was clutching his fist and baring his teeth. “What the fuck?”he growled. With a grim glare in her direction, he tried to shove her aside. Dexterously, she parried his movements and sent him to the ground.</p><p>  Everyone stopped dead in their tracks.</p><p>  The others rushed to assist their leader. Meanwhile, /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ ‘s escorts intervened at last, barreling down the steps. One of them grabbed her wrist, tugged her away. “/̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ !” he admonished. She stayed firm in her spot. “What did I tell you about getting close to humans!?”</p><p>  “Isn’t it my duty to protect humans?” she asked, innocently.</p><p>  “Not these humans. They’re hardly even human…”</p><p>  That was when /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  looked over her shoulder and saw the boy’s face. Those olive green eyes were stunning— the likes of which, she’ll never forget. She saw him staring back at her and he looked at a loss for words, just as she was. Time froze for a moment. Then she was dragged away, dragged out of her daydream, back up the steps and out of the stifling air.</p><p>  <em> Strange </em> . Stifling as the air was, that was the only moment she felt <b>ERROR</b></p><p>  /̵͔̬̀\̶̢̈͌/̸̦̣̅͝\̴̡̈́͆.̷̄͜͝*̴͓͓̄0̷͍͒'̷̛̤͠ͅ'̸̛̜̟̓}̷͙̇\̶̗͝/̶͈͑ͅ  returned to the bridge.
