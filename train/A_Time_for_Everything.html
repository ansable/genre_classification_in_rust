<div class="userstuff">
  <p><em>'Oh, its raining again'</em>. There was something in the air tonight aboard the Hogwart’s Express. A cold and intruding feeling that overwhelmed the young witch from head to toe. Only she and another filled the compartment. The calm and quiet atmosphere was a stark difference to the pounding feet and excited chatter that occurred outside. She heard first years panicking, 2nd years reuniting with friends they had made, 5th years groaning at their upcoming O.W.L’s and 7th years discussing the latest news about the criminal who escaped Azkaban, Sirius Black. Her breath fogged up the window she peered through absentmindedly. She watched as the night crawled nearer with every second that passed. The vast, endless greenery succumbing to the darkness turning into a blur of shadowy lands; a stark contrast to the misty mountains of Beauxbatons she was once acquainted to. Even if she had only attended for a year, who would have thought Ellyanna 'Elly' Aevum would have transferred from her serene French academy to the British wizarding school Hogwarts in her second year which so happened to have housed a monster that attacked muggleborns in that very same year. Not to mention that the famous Harry Potter attended the same school, in the same year as her and in the same house. Quite an experience for her first year in Hogwarts. Her mother and father had reacted on separate ends of the spectrum when she had explained her year in Hogwarts. Oh, her mother and father, Iris and Henry Aevum, how much she missed them already.</p><p>“Thinking of mama and papa again, Elly?” Her eyes slowly wandered to the male opposite her, her older twin brother, Klaus Aevum. He held a strong gaze on his little sister as he unboxed his chocolate frog, his bangs messily swept on his sharp and prominent face. He blended with his fellow housemates, Slytherins. They each upheld a sense of authority (or superiority in majority of cases) but she loved the protective aura her brother always gave her. She admired him. She looked up to him. She gave a lazy upwards quirk of the lips and a small nod in reply as she watched his eyes glow in warmth before stuffing yet another piece of his chocolate frog into his mouth. The compartment become silent once again as Klaus ate his chocolate. A habit that became of the twins whom used to get criticised for talking with their mouths full by their mother. “She’s probably back in France now. Have you owled her yet?”</p><p>“Nope, I was hoping you would since I ended up getting the howler last time after writing about the chamber of secrets fiasco.” She replied with a glint of past encounters flashing in her mind.</p><p>Klaus laughed recalling the howler their mother had sent to Elly just moments before she, herself, appeared to physically howl at Klaus during their return to their house in Britain for the summer. If there was one thing they could say aloud, it would be that their mother’s rage petrified them more than the rumours of the basilisk last year. Even if her mother was not there most of the time due to her rather-demanding job in the Ministre des Affaires Magiques de la France, she was still a force to be reckoned with. Kind of like her brother. Except her brother never directed his anger at her but the people who opposed her.</p><p>“Tomorrow?”</p><p>He smirked with a playful glint in his eyes, <em>“Tempus neminem manet.”</em></p><p>“Tomorrow.” She finalized shooting a wink to her brother before going back to staring out the window. It had gotten darker in the space of a few minutes. Soon the skies would lose its amber haze and be replaced by the sapphire shield of the night amidst the rain. Sapphire. She snuck a peak at her brother again who was also staring out the window contempt with how life was right now. His eyes were like hers. They were, as their father had once described it, ‘Iris’ tiny bead of sapphire slotted into our eye sockets.’ With fair skin and black velvet hair, Elly thought to herself for a second. They were sort of the embodiment of the night sky right now. Their eyes and hair embodied the night sky while their fair skin embodied the moon and stars. Whilst they inherited their looks from their mother, Klaus had his father’s firey temper. Elly was more of a laidback individual like her mother. If Henry was fire, Iris was water. The two cannot live without the other.</p><p>“Greeting Aevum, And other Aevum.”</p><p>The twins both looked towards the door which had unceremoniously slid open with a bang by the platinum bombshell in the black turtleneck and silk black suit followed around by his henchmen. His sharp nose as high as his pretty tall height. <em>‘He’s grown taller,’</em> She thought as she stared down the Slytherin. He was leaning on the left side of the door, her side of the door, as he gave a smug smile to Klaus before staring blankly at Elly. She continued to stare, admiring the loss of his baby fat over the summer and the growth spurt as well. He was looking good.<br/> Though she rarely spoke to Draco, due to the resentment he had towards Gryffindors overall but especially the spiteful remarks he would throw towards her friends. He was quite a pompous idiot sometimes. Clever, but arrogant. He never really targeted her but they’ve had their moments. She wondered how Klaus and Draco had become friends but then she remembered they both had a sense of leadership and authority that became the common grounds to their friendship.</p><p>“Malfoy, had a good summer?” Klaus grinned towards him as he patted the seat beside him. Draco obliged, seating himself with Crabbe beside him. Elly noticed the quick, hard look Draco gave to Goyle as he sat himself on the opposite edge of her seat. “Sorry again, never got back to your owl.”</p><p>“S’all good mate. But get a load of this. My father and I were discussing Sirius Black-” And this is the moment she zoned out of the conversation. She thought about other things, like what Hermione’s new cat looked like, or if Ron had finally gotten a replacement wand, or what sort of mayhem Harry has been up to so far. She thought about her other friends too. Like whether the acne serum she purchased for Katie Bell from Madam Primpernelle’s beautifying potions worked, or if Fleur de la cour and Rose Valentine, her seniors from Beauxbatons that she looked up to, had received her box of home-made pumpkin pasties that she and her mum had made.<br/> “So what do you think Aevum?”</p><p>She snapped out of her thought bubble and glanced at her brother and Draco in confusion. “Thoughts on?”</p><p>“Blimey. Get your head out of the gutter.” Klaus teased. Goyle and Crabbe snickered in the background.</p><p>“I wouldn’t blame her. Being a Gryffindor is basically the scourge of Hogwarts. Such a trash house,” Draco added. “You would’ve been better off in Slytherin with me.”</p><p>“I’d rather bite my arm off,” She retaliated. “Gryffindor is a good house filled with good people. I’d generally hope you take back what you said before I bite your—"</p><p>Suddenly, the train halted. And all went eerily quiet. You could drop a pin on the carpeted floor beneath them and it would still pierce through the sudden silence. Elly gulped. She scooched closer to the edge of the seat as she felt an uncomfortable feeling take over her. The intruding feeling that shook her earlier heightened. She let out a shakey breath she didn’t even know she was holding as the lights began to flicker. The hair on her arms began to rise on its end and chills ran up and down her spine like a pianist playing a glissando on every joint in her spine.</p><p>“W-whats happening Malfoy?”</p><p>“How am I supposed to know Crabbe? Go check it out.”</p><p>Klaus pushed Draco slightly who jumped at the sudden contact. If the mood had not been so creepy, Elly would have giggled at his jumpiness right now. She looked over to Goyle who was now cowering in his seat and Crabbe who almost looked petrified. “Elly, come here right now.” Klaus extended his hand towards her which she held instantly. She didn’t question her brother’s judgement as he pulled her to sit between him and Draco. She scooched closer to Klaus as pulled out his wand and held his hand tighter as the lights went out. She heard Crabbe and Goyle scream at the sudden blackout. She felt Draco quiver as he scooched closer to her, obviously as scared as a mouse caught in a snake’s trap. She grabbed his arm. Not to calm him down, but herself. She was shaking and she bet Draco and Klaus could both feel it.</p><p>It felt like the atmosphere had just diminished. And all that was left was a bitter unhappiness. The fear increased tenfold within the compartment as they watched a tall, flowy and dark entity float by. A dementor. A dark and brooding creature that guarded Azkaban. It toyed with people’s emotions. Fed on their fears. There was nothing good about dementors. They were emotionless entities that nobody ever wanted to encounter in their lives.</p><p>But if Dementors usually guarded Azkaban, What were they doing here?</p><p>“Does this mean Sirius Black is closeby?” She whispered. She felt Draco move, probably to (somehow) glare at her in the dark for breaking the awkward silence. “The dementors.. on the train though?”</p><p>“Who knows,” Draco replied in a hushed voice. “I’d stay away from Potter if I were you, Aevum.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Just trust me.”</p><p>“Why should I trust you?”</p><p>He looked straight at her as the lights went on and the train began moving again. The grip Klaus had on her hand tighter than ever now. “You can trust me. I haven’t given you a reason not to, have I?”</p><p>“No,”</p><p>“Then do it. Not for my sake. But for your worrisome brother over here.”</p><p>“What do you know that I don’t?” She was curious.</p><p>Yet he only grinned, showing his perfect whites to her teasingly.</p>

  <p>News of Harry Potter fainting at the sight of dementors spread like wildfire. Everyone had been mentioning it from the moment both Elly and Klaus had stepped off the express and made their way to Hogwarts. As the two bid goodbye to each other in one of the halls, Elly had easily tracked down the trio due to Hermione’s bushy (but not as bushy compared to last year) brown hair. As she scampered towards the three ready to ask what happened, she noticed Harry looking a little distraught. The meek smile he gave her was an instant warning not to ask what happened yet. So, she opted to just talk about their summers. <em>A note which Harry gladly thanked her for.</em></p><p> </p><p>“You…blew up your aunt? Like a balloon?” She laughed as the quartet sat down in the great hall for the first assembly. She next to Hermione and the boys opposite them.</p><p>“By accident, of course,” Harry began as he took a sip from his goblet. “Fudge said I was off the hook since it was accidental underage magic. Met him at the Leaky Cauldron.”</p><p>“Woah. I wish I could do that to people.”</p><p>“No, you don’t,” Hermione snapped. “You could be in jail for that. Or worse, get expelled from Hogwarts for doing that to a muggle.”</p><p>“Then do it to Malfoy,” Ron sniggered as he noticed him and his cohorts descend into the table opposite to them. “He looks like he could do with a little more meat on his bones anyway,”</p><p> Elly giggled at this before turning her attention to the frog choir as they began to sing a song. Though they sang in English about double trouble? (Were they referring to her favourite red headed twins? I hope they were) She loved when they sang in Latin. She loved trying to sing in Latin. “Maybe I should join the choir.”</p><p> "And hold a frog?” Hermione whispered. They looked at each other and shuddered. The sliminess. As the song finished, they clapped politely.</p><p> </p><p>“Welcome, welcome to another year at Hogwarts.” Albus Dumbledore began. “Now I’d like to say a few words before we all become befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I am pleased to welcome Professor R. J. Lupin who’s kindly consented to fill the post of Defence against the dark arts teacher. Good luck professor.”</p><p>The hall clapped as an almost frail looking man stood up next to Professor Snape and bowed slightly in his tattered-looking robes. She noticed him and quirked her eyebrows, she had seen that face before. He looked sick, like he had just been released from St Mungo’s as he warily sat down. She glanced over to see Klaus’ reaction but realized he was nowhere to be found.</p><p>“Of course, that’s why he knew to give you the chocolate Harry,” Hermione commented before turning towards Elly in a more hushed tone. “Professor Lupin was there when the dementor sorta attacked Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>“Potter.” Draco called. “Potter!” They all turned towards Draco. “Is it true you fainted?” The boy next to Draco dramatically acting out what would be Harry fainting. “I mean you actually fainted?” He added emphasising the last bit.</p><p>“Shove off Malfoy,” Ron grunted.</p><p>“How did he find out?” Harry groaned.</p><p>“People have been talking about it. That’s how Klaus and I found out too,” Elly replied.</p><p>“Just forget it,” Hermione sighed.</p><p>“Where is your brother anyway? He’s usually with them,” Ron had asked glancing behind him.</p><p>“Probably sitting with some other people,” She shrugged.</p><p>“Maybe he’s finally realized how big of a git Malfoy is and told him to sod off too.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fortunately, I am delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own, Rubeus Hagrid.” The crowd applauded again, a bigger cheer coming from the Gryffindor table as Hagrid greeted the students as the new care of magical creatures’ teacher.</p><p>“Did everyone take his course?” Elly asked. The trio nodded. “Good, I didn’t want to be alone.”</p><p>As Dumbledore began to discuss the dementors, Elly felt a chill run down her spine again. The eruption of whispers about dementors and Sirius Black were unnerving. She grabbed Hermione’s arm under the table in reassurance as she saw the uncomfortable look plastered on her face.</p><p>“But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“I picked this up at Madam Primpernelle’s,” Elly said as she threw a bottle at Hermione’s bed. “It’s supposed to help brighten your skin but honestly, I see no difference.”</p><p>The two had retreated into their dorm which they shared with Lavender, Parvati Patel and Fay Dunbar. The girls had all huddled around Hermione and Elly’s bed, which were next to each other as they caught up with each other. All of them were on speaking terms. Though Lavender and Parvati were inseparable, and Fay was always with her boyfriend, a 4th year Ravenclaw by the name of Troy Carpenter.</p><p>“You need a speak-up vial, Elly.” Parvati joked. “You’re almost as quiet as your brother.”</p><p>“I can’t help but only speak up when i'm with Klaus. I'm loyal to my twin. Why am I not in Hufflepuff?” She wondered.</p><p>“Because you have a knack for hexing people once your brother is involved,” Lavender giggled as they recalled last year when she had ‘accidentally swivelled her wand and executed a leg-lock hex towards Pansy Parkinson as she bad-mouthed Hermione and shouted at Klaus for siding with Gryffindors. She received a week of detention from Professor Snape, but it was all worth it. “No Hufflepuff would do that in front of Professor Snape.”</p><p>“In my defence, I didn’t even know he was there.” Or in Elly’s eyes, she saw his brooding form and pretended it was just another shadow and her actions were justified by the fact that her brother was involved. Very justified.</p><p> </p><p>“But that was still wrong,” Hermione pointed out before picking up the vial. “And thanks for this, I’m gonna need it this year.”</p><p>“Oh, I should really check out what my schedule looks like this year.” Fay muttered dreading the first day back tomorrow. The girls retreated leaving Hermione and Elly alone. At this point, Elly had transferred to Hermione’s bed for a quick chat before lights out.</p><p>“Blimey ‘Mione,” Elly cringed looking at the mess that was her schedule for the year. “How many courses did you elect for this year?”</p><p>“A fair few,” She replied meekly as she grabbed a thick book from her bedside. It read 'Spellman's Syllabry'. "What did you elect for this year Elly?"</p><p>"Divination, arithmancy and care of magical creatures."</p><p>"Well, at least we'll be together for the classes."</p><p>Elly's eyebrows furrowed, "You might want to ask Professor McGonagall about your timetable. There’s a lot of things clashing right now."</p><p>"Right..."</p><p>She was convinced that Hermione knew that the classes would clash. Seeing as how it was right there in front of her, printed in the parchment.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey... Do you miss Beauxbatons?" Hermione asked as she began to organize her books in a neat and towering pile on her desk.</p><p>"I guess in a way. I do miss the wooden nymphs who would serenade everyone while we ate. Not to mention the mountain views and gardens scattered around the castle," She thought. "But I guess I like it here too. The people are nice. The land is pretty. and I've made some good friends too."</p><p>"Not everyone is nice," Hermione muttered. “Just... do me a favour, okay?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Stay away from Malfoy, would you?”</p><p>Elly cocked her head in confusion, “And…why are you saying this out of the blue?”</p><p>“Just trust me,” She said. “Don’t you think he’s slimier than a toad?”</p><p>“What do you know that I don’t?” She was curious. This was the exact same scene that happened with Draco in the train earlier.</p><p>And she didn’t get a reply from her either.</p>

  <em>I should stop now. This is the kind of talks I must save for when I see your beautiful face. Write to me soon? I've also got another little package for you coming soon. A little present mama has designed specifically for you.</em>

  <em>A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, smile for me?</em>
  <br/>
  <em> Rose</em>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Elly smiled happily as she read the neat little letter. She missed Rose a lot. Though she was a half-blood, she was exceptionally bright in Potions, which was in her favour as potions was one of her least favoured subjects, and quite the heart-throb whom waltzed the walls of Beauxbatons with her signature rose red lipstick. Her mother was a muggle designer and her father worked as the charms professor in Beauxbatons. He had always favoured Elly for her natural talent in charms and often let the two, along with Fleur and a few other girls, to use the rooms to practice charms together.</p>
<p>'<em>Note to self: reply later,</em>' She thought as she walked with Klaus towards their first lesson, divination. Her freshly washed hair bounced with every step she took as she chatted with Klaus about taking extra classes and other activities. Ron, Harry and Hermione behind them deep into their own conversation. Not too far from them, she noticed Malfoy and his gang strutting down towards their class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What about the frog choir?" Klaus suggested.</p>
<p>"I thought about it. Slimey frogs sums up my thoughts on it. Might give it a chance? So many choices, so little time." She pondered as they turned into the endless spiralling stairs that led to the divination classroom. "What about you?"</p>
<p>"Might try for quidditch actually," He shrugged. "The guys suggested I’d make a good chaser or even an alternate, but who knows?"</p>
<p>"That would be wicked," Harry said as he joined into their conversation alongside Ron. "Having a fair Slytherin in the team for once."</p>
<p>Klaus shrugged, "We'll see."</p>
<p>Elly noticed the change in atmosphere once Harry had joined their conversation. He probably heeded Draco's words from the train ride and kept a distance from Harry. A short distance, since Elly was well acquainted with the boy who lived. "Tempus neminem manet,” She said.</p>
<p>"Tempus-what mate?" Ron's eyebrow arched at the unknown words. "What in the bloody hell does that mean? That’s definitely not English."</p>
<p>"Well pointed Ronny," She chuckled glancing back at the boys. "Its Latin. Also, where's Hermione?"</p>
<p>He looked back and shrugged, "Probably went to the bathroom?"</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> “I am Professor Trelawney and together we shall cast ourselves into the future!” Professor Trelawney, the divination teacher, excitedly remarked as she stared down the students behind her over-magnifying spectacles. Her hair bushier than Hermione’s and her green robes as off-putting as her attitude. “This term, we shall be focusing on tessomancy, which is the art of reading tea leaves, so please take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.”</p>
<p>Elly grabbed Klaus’ teacup while he had a nap on the small circular table draped with an ancient-looking cloth. In front of her, were Harry and Ron in the front row also swapping teacups. She drowned out Professor Trelawney’s mystic and dream-like voice as she scanned the divination classroom. The small class was decorated with ancient rugs and other odd artefacts which either dangled from a string or collected dust in the cupboards around. The strong potpourri burned through her nostrils and she constantly wrinkled and wiped her nose hoping to get rid of the smell. It felt as ancient and odd as the room she sat in.</p>
<p>“But first you must broaden your mind,” Professor Trelawney said as she grabbed Seamus’ head with both her hands and shook it gently back and forth. “First, you must look beyond!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What a load of rubbish,” Hermione sneered as she sat with Harry and Ron. Elly did a double check. There, sitting in between the duo, was Hermione taking out her books and adjusting her uniform. Her hair brought up in a half-up do as she appeared as real as can be.</p>
<p>“Where did you come from?!” Ron asked in shock as Hermione stared behind at a napping Klaus and Elly.</p>
<p>“Me? I’ve been here all this time, right Elly?” Hermione asked as she stared at Elly with a ‘I’ll-tell-you-later’ look.</p>
<p>“Honestly Ron, you might need to borrow Harry’s glasses,” Elly teased as she playfully rolled her eyes. “You’re not very observant, are ya?”</p>
<p>“What? I’m the most observant one here.” Ron replied crossing his arms on the desk. “Theres a lot of things you haven’t witnessed like I have.”</p>
<p>Elly raised an eyebrow, “Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like M-oof, Like me stealing the last apples in the morning so you would eat something else,” Ron grumbled slowly as he gave a hard stare at Harry. She noticed the way the clothed table had jumped slightly. Obviously Harry had stomped on Ron’s foot under the table while he pretended to listen to the professor. And of course, they'd use her love for apples against her. How typical of little Ronny.</p>
<p>“I’ll make sure to take all the bacon starting from tomorrow,” She shrugged. As much as she wanted to know, she knew how hard headed the trio can be and stubborn enough to keep their mouth shut. She would have to do it when they were alone, or in this case, when Hermione was alone. Though she was good friends with the trio, she was very close with Hermione and a lot closer to other guys in comparison to Harry and Ron.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before Ron could argue, the lesson had begun. Or had tried to. She had asked Klaus for help on what she was suppose to see but Klaus had decided to take a small nap instead. He playfully told her off to pay attention in classes before skimming through his book: 'Unfogging the Future' by Seer Cassandra Vablatsky. He also told the three to check for any sort of imagery that appeared below and around the cup. Elly nodded as she began trying to search for some sort of image within the wet clumps of tea leaves. She struggled, eyebrows knotting as she rotated the cup round and round.</p>
<p>"Right, what can you see in mine?" Ron asked.</p>
<p>"A load of soggy brown stuff," Harry replied.</p>
<p>Elly laughed as she glanced down at her own cup. All she saw were soggy brown stuff. <em>Oh?</em> Maybe some sort of image in it? It looked like…a clump of soggy brown stuff. She craned her neck left. Then right. Squinted a little bit and brought the cup closer and further from her. All she saw were soggy brown stuff.</p>
<p>"Damnit Harry, I can't unsee it now," She moaned causing Harry to glance at her and chuckle.</p>
<p>"You didn't even see anything in the first place, you numpty," Klaus chuckled. He swished his bangs out of the way and scrutinised the teacup. "I think I see a flower? Or a bud? Or an acorn? One of those. I see a bird..maybe some sort of falcon or eagle, and a sun not far away" He scanned through his book. “Happiness, deadly enemies? My own sister? With enemies of her own? No way. I don’t believe this now. This is utter bull-"</p>
<p>“Klaus!” Elly interrupted in a hushed voice as she saw students look back at Klaus in shock from his outburst and his almost-curse word. She tutted at them, obviously annoyed at their nosey stares, before looking back at her brother who now appeared bothered by the teacup. “I’m sure it just means Parkinson,” She reasoned. Uncertainty dripping with every word but she knew it was enough to console her brother. She knew how fiery his temper can be. The saying ‘if looks can kill’ is an understatement to the emotions her brother can hold in his sapphire eyes. Having been in Beauxbatons, she learnt how ill-tempered the students can become. Much like Klaus who would’ve fitted into the norm of the Beauxbaton students. Though she may have her own outbursts, it wasn’t as wild as the Italian students or the French students. Now they were expressive. They were no stranger to a retortion. Where emotions ran wild at Beauxbatons, they hid behind closed doors in Hogwarts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Whatever,” He sighed as he pushed the teacup away. “Just tell me what you see in mine.”</p>
<p>In other words, ‘<em>distract me</em>’.</p>
<p>“Soggy brown stuff,” She replied.</p>
<p>Klaus relaxed and snorted. “You’re actually a numpty.”</p>
<p>“Blame Harry,” She scoffed nodding towards Harry, whom had now turned around with the other two.</p>
<p>“Me? I can’t see very clearly,” Harry defended with bright eyes behind his circular spectacles. “Maybe you need glasses too Elly,” He teased further referring to Elly’s earlier comment.</p>
<p>“Let me try yours on Harry?” She asked as she reached over and grabbed the glasses from Harry. She slid them on and blinked around, trying to adjust to the sight in front of her… Which wasn’t much. The glasses made everything feel like it was miles away and hidden behind a shroud of blurriness. “Oh man, I wanted to foresee my brother’s readings in this marvellous cup of porcelain beneath me… but goodness, your eyesight is horrible. I can’t even see where the teacup is and it feels like Ron is a mile away from me” she cringed as she took the glasses off and blinked away the blurry room. The sounds of laughter surrounded her.</p>
<p>“Serves you right Elly,” Ron joked. “Shoulda saw it coming, I did. And that’s shocking in itself.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh! Oh!” Professor Trelawney enthusiastically waved her hands in the air as she sauntered towards where they all sat. “Your aura is pulsing dear. Are you in the beyond? I think you are.”</p>
<p>Elly smirked in the background with Klaus. The twins leaned onto the table and stared down at poor Ron. Hermione leaned back, the smug look on her face identical to the twins.</p>
<p>“Er…Yeah erm,” He said as he hurriedly searched for some sort of image, or sight, or whatever you were meant to find. He was panicking. “Harry’s got some sort of wonky cross? ..and that there could be the sun and that’s happiness.. so you’re gonna suffer, but you’re gonna be happy about it.”</p>
<p>“What?” Elly laughed at the ridiculous reading Ron had read. “Now that’s utter bull-“</p>
<p>“Give me the cup,” Professor Trelawney interrupted as she grabbed the cup from Ron. A shriek erupted from her as she dropped the cup in shock. The rest of the class stopped to turn towards the five. Elly had ceased laughing and was ready to stand up with her brother whom also felt alert after seeing Professor Trelawney’s reaction. “My dear, you have the grim.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Klaus had gone on ahead, obviously a bit riled up from Divination and muttering to her about joining friends and possibly dropping the elective course. She had bid him goodbye as he softly kissed her forehead, a notion of sibling affection they had always done since they were children, as he rushed as fast as he could away from divination. The grim had been defined as a dark omen, an omen of death. Something that clearly shocked everyone in the room as whispers began to spread and simmer as they stared at a rigid Harry. He sat with in unreadable expression as he thought about the tea leaf reading. As the four descended to Hagrid’s hut at a casual pace, Ron and Hermione began to discuss about the reading whilst Harry informed her on what she had missed out on while they were on the Hogwarts express.</p><p>“Sirius Black escaped to come after you?” She gasped in a hushed tone noticing stray students around heading to their next classes. “That’s preposterous, why would he come after you?”</p><p>“I dunno,” Harry shrugged, still shaken from divination. “But Ron’s father who works in the Ministry warned me not to look for him.”</p><p>“I,” She paused trying to calculate what to say. “That’s just… woah.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry sighed.</p><p>She gave Harry a short glance noting down the downhearted aura he gave off. She cringed. “We don’t know everything, let’s just keep it like that for now and just continue on. Divination is a bit loopy in my opinion,” Elly shrugged trying to mend the mood. “Right now, let’s just focus on catching up with the two and enjoy the rest of the day. We can discuss this later once we’re all at dinner or something. Oh! Care of magical creatures, I’m looking forward to this! I love magical creatures. My would you look at that? Ronny and ‘Mione are way too ahead, tally ho Harry-o!”</p><p>Before Harry could reply, Elly linked her arm with Harry’s and fastened her pace towards Ron and Hermione. She felt the grip from Harry’s arm tighten for a second as he muttered a quick ‘thanks’ and matched her pace as they both descended down the stairs.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hagrid’s hut was located just outside of the forbidden forest. To others it appeared small and tattered but to Elly, it looked cosy. With pumpkin patches surrounding the lot and a great view, what more could you need? She had noticed that a vast number of Slytherin’s were already there waiting with Hagrid for the straggling few students who were approaching. One Slytherin with silvery-blonde hair that almost appeared white in the sunlight, had been staring at her, or staring at her and Harry’s arm intertwined. He stayed mute as his friends muttered and sniggered around them. His unreadable expression darkened more when their eyes met. He scowled, noticing the way Harry’s arm tightened around hers in an almost competitive way. Elly glanced up at Harry, only now noticing how much he had grown over the summer as he was now a few centimetres taller than she. He only smiled down at her, causing her to smile back. She nodded towards Klaus, whom nodded back before turning back towards the Slytherin girl beside him. She had whispered something in his ear as he chuckled and leaned towards her and whispered something back. Elly smiled making a mental note to ask more details about her as all good siblings do.</p><p>“I’gotta real treat fo’ ‘yah today, a great lesson. Now follow me,” Hagrid enthusiastically announced as he began to lead the Gryffindor and Slytherin students into the forest. All the while, Harry never loosened his grip on Elly.</p><p>“Gotta make sure you don’t fall.” Harry said as he guided her with him. “I know how clumsy you can get Elly.”</p><p>“That was one time,” She pouted, “And it was Bullstrode’s fault I tripped in the first place.”</p><p>“Exactly, she’s a few rows back yakno, gotta make sure you don’t hi-five the ground with your face again.”</p><p>“Oh, sod off Harry,” She whined as Harry began to laugh at her face. “You’re actually a twat sometimes.”</p><p>“And you love me for it,” Harry whispered smugly as he nudged their intertwined arms.</p><p>“Can’t argue there,” She giggled as they walked into a clearing within the woods. They unlinked their arms and dug on for their monster of a monster book which snarled upon contact with her hand. She cringed as she held the belted loop of the book in one hand and attempted to adjust her bag with the other. She walked over to the broken wall that lined the clearing and dropped her book on a near flat part before adjusting her bag on her shoulder.</p><p>“Tired, Aevum?” A voice taunted behind her. She whipped her head back, her long ebony hair swishing in the air before landing back to caress her back and shoulder. He smirked playfully and jealously. “You should get Potter to carry your bag like the good little boy he is.”</p><p>She glared at Draco. Eyes narrowing, and a huff escaped her lips as she turned so her whole body was now facing the Slytherin whom stood a few feet away. She felt disgusted at the way he had spoken Harry’s surname like it was a horrible concoction he was forced to drink and the insinuation of Harry being her own personal hand-carrier. With hands on her hips, her bag almost falling off her shoulder, she huffed once again. “Don’t you dare speak of my friend like that.”</p><p>“Oh? Just a friend, is he? Seemed more like something else if you ask me. Wanna share that with everyone?” He taunted even louder causing a few students to turn their heads and whisper. His eyes brightened, and a coy smile played on his pink lips. “Got something with Potter aye, Aevum?”</p><p>“I dislike your insinuating tone, Malfoy.” Elly grimaced as she saw Klaus coming towards them in the corner of her eyes. “Though, if I did, would that really be a problem?”</p><p>Before Draco could taunt once more, she twisted back, snatched the book from the wall and hurried towards the nearest Gryffindor, who turned out to be Dean Thomas.</p><p>“Malfoy being a prick to ya?” Dean asked as they began stroking the somewhat smooth spine of the book. She shook her head as she watched the monstrous book begin to ease up. Its snarls turned to a sound similar to a cat’s purr as its eyes began to close.</p><p>“More like Malfoy being Malfoy,” She shrugged with Dean as they walked close to the trio in the front. She shrugged off her bag heaving a big sigh of relief as she began to roll her hair into a low bun. The few shorter strands of her hair framed her face as she secured her bun with the hair tie she always wore on right wrist.</p><p>“I think they’re funny.” Hermione said. Though whether it was sarcastic, or she actually meant it, Elly may never know. What she did notice was the interesting necklace with an antique looking accessory that hid between the slits of her buttoned shirt. What a pretty, little trinket.</p><p>“Oh yeah, terribly funny, really witty” Draco called from the large tree in the back of the crowd. Sarcasm dripping with every word. He scanned around the area, sneaking a glance to Elly whom eyes met once again before turning back towards the trio slightly to her left. “God this place has gone to the dumps. Wait ‘til my father hears Dumbledore’s got this oaf teaching classes.”</p><p>Beside him, Crabbe and Goyle gloated loudly as his other friends snickered in the background. Elly noticed Klaus silently sigh a distance away, standing beside the same Slytherin girl he was whispering to earlier, as she took a step forward. She may not know Hagrid on a personal level but that still doesn’t give someone permission to berate a teacher on his first class. Before she could take another step towards Draco, whom now straightened his posture in curiosity, Harry pushed her back as he stepped closer towards Malfoy’s gang. His eyes focusing on Malfoy alone as if trying to kill his soul rather than his own body.</p><p>“Shut up Malfoy,” Harry warned him.</p><p>The echoes of ‘ooo’s erupted from his little gang as Draco dropped his bag off with Crabbe and swaggered closer to Harry. His eyes beaming with confidence and a smug little smile dancing on his lips as he stared. Until he began to back off, his eyes filled with panic and his lips trembling as he shakily pointed towards the sky.</p><p>“Dementor! Dementor!” Draco shouted.</p><p>Elly turned in alarm, along with everyone else, to see nothing but branches covered with fading green leaves and the trapped sunrays which beamed down towards the clearing. If things were not the way they were, she might have laughed along with Draco and his gang who all belted their laughter with hoods up like dementors. She tried not to show any expression as she watched Draco (and unfortunately Parkinson) wiggle their fingers like dementors towards her. “Gits,” She called before turning away from her towards Hagrid now followed by two very tall creatures. “Oh, my goodness, they’re beautiful.”</p><p>She couldn’t stop staring at the two magnificent creatures before her. They’re beaks sharp and pointed upwards in a proud notion as they made careful steps towards where Hagrid stood. Hagrid beaming with pride as the two creatures scanned the areas around them. Their eagle-like eyes focusing on the miniscule details of the clearing around them as they trotted closer at the sight of a dead ferret in Hagrid’s hand. A hippogriff. With the upper half of an eagle and bottom half of a horse and the emotional wiring of a TNT. Their sharp talons could slice through anything and their beaks can devour even the hardest of meats so long as their hunger for food was big enough. One of the two, a stormy grey hippogriff, stood on its hind legs as it caught the dead ferret with its beak. The other, a pinkish roan colour with amber eyes identical to the stormy hippogriff, chirped before ducking down to clean its feathers. Its wings began to open, showing its magnificent length and width with spread to double its own body length. The wings jerked, the white pattern underneath its wings fluttering with every shudder as the hippogriff cleaned itself.</p><p>“Aren’t they bea’iful?” Hagrid smiled wider, “Say ‘ello ter Buckbeak an’ Stormswif’,”</p><p>“Exactly what are they?” Ron had asked astounded at the creatures before him.</p><p>“Hippogriffs Ron,” Elly replied dreamily never taking her eyes off the pinkish Hippogriff whom had now finished cleaning its wings and had now began to stare curiously at her. “Proud and beautiful creatures, they are.”</p><p>“Thas’ right Miss Aevum. 5 points ter Gryffindor,” Hagrid clapped happily towards her in his thick accent before turning to the rest of the classes. “They’ also very easily offended. Yer do not wan’ ta insult a ‘ippogriff, it may just be the last thing ya ever do. Now, who’d like ter come an’ say ‘ello?”</p><p>Elly stayed in place, still staring at the hippogriff named Stormswift in front of her. She had encountered hippogriffs before back in Beauxbatons. Once gaining their trust, you could approach them as long as you present yourself with the utmost respect for the creatures. She loved the exuberant pride they showed and their majestic wingspan that seemed to just let her soar above the clouds. She hated flying with a broomstick, having been acquainted with riding upon winged creatures and carriages back in Beauxbatons and loved the feeling of flying on winged creatures such as Hippogriffs.</p><p>“Well done ‘Arry, Well done Miss Aevum,” Hagrid called snapping Elly from her gaze a bit towards Hagrid. She looked around to see only both Harry and she stood in the space that was populated mere seconds ago. The two glanced back to see the rest of the class had scattered towards the back hoping not to get picked. Unlike Elly, Harry had not wanted to get picked and gave her a panicked, frustrated look.</p><p>‘Follow me,’ Elly mouthed as she sauntered towards Stormswift. Harry slowly walked to Buckbeak as Hagrid began to give out instructions on how to properly gain the trust of a hippogriff. Following what Hagrid was saying, she stared back at the hippogriff whom still hadn’t taken its eyes off her. She bowed slightly at Stormswift who cocked its head left and right, fluttered its wings slightly with furrowed eyebrows before slowly descending into a bow. However, its head jerked back at the frightful call of Buckbeak whom was now flapping its wings territoriality.</p><p>“Back off you two, back off.” Hagrid warned motioning for the two to get away.</p><p>Harry began to walk back as quickly as it could. Until he snapped a tree branch. Then all matters of life seemed to be muted as the only sound came from the small flapping noises Stormswift began to make and the distance chirps of birds in the forest. Elly stayed still as Stormswift came closer to her and stood in front in a protective manner.</p><p>“Keep still Harry,” Elly snapped as she began to run her hand over the hippogriff’s neck. Stormswift purred in response, keeping a close eye on Harry. “It’s only a warning. The more you show fear, the more you lose trust in Hippogriffs. Keep eye contact with Buckbeak, it will prove you’re not afraid and you still respect him,” She further lectured as Harry gulped and nodded.</p><p>Harry kept petrifyingly still as he kept his eyes focused on Buckbeak whom had stopped its cries and was beginning to calm down. She glanced at the audience away from them as they gave bewildered stares at the stark difference in demonstrations before them. On one hand, a young Gryffindor had easily gained its trust and was now stroking the creature like they would any other owl. On the other hand, a young Gryffindor was fearing for his life waiting to see if he had gained its trust yet and wanting to blink so badly his eyes were watering a bit.</p><p>She smirked at Klaus who now stood in the front with Malfoy’s gang. He nodded and smiled impressed by her as he leaned towards the Slytherin girl once more. The two began to exchange whispers to themselves as she scanned the other bewildered faces for a moment. Crabbe and Goyle looked as lost a man in a foreign country, Parkinson tried to look as unimpressed as she could muster whilst clinging to the next boy. Draco. Draco just stared. The unreadable expression etched onto his face once again as he traced the way Elly stroked the hippogriffs neck switching from light, gentle strokes to scratching and caressing the inner roots of the hippogriff’s feathers. His head cocked slightly in silent amusement as he stared back at her. Steel and Sapphire eyes meeting for the umpteenth time today as she added more pressure in her petting. She always wondered what he could be thinking when his expression became like this. It was always when she was in the spotlight, or when she was with the trio and he directed the conversation with her that his expressions became so... fake with pride A notion very odd to her as she knew how much Draco liked to grimace and boast when in the spotlight. Yet, when she was alone or with her brother, his face was as open as a book. Any form of negative or positive emotion was as clear as day. It puzzled her, another puzzle to the piece she called ‘Draco Malfoy’. He slowly raised his hand, eyes still connected in an invisible trance, as he took another bite of the green apple he carried. He blinked at her, eyebrows raising as she zoomed in on the apple.</p><p>She blinked away her thoughts of hunger and turned away from him to see how Harry was coping with Buckbeak. She flushed thinking who may have caught her staring at him, or worse, who caught them staring at each other. She hoped not quickly glancing at the crowd whom, beside Draco, focused on Harry’s demonstration. She mentally thanked Merlin as she focused back on Harry, whom now was instructed to pet Buckbeak. She cringed at the instruction. She knew how cautious Hippogriffs can be and with Harry’s undetermined posture, it may seem fatal.</p><p>But then she remembered why he was so famous, and why he’s everyone’s celebrity hero as she saw how determined he became to pet Buckbeak. The gulp he made as he was nearly nipped at by Buckbeak would have made any other student jump away in fear, but not Harry. Harry was determined and brave. Ignoring the consequences if only for a while to achieve the satisfaction he craved. She smiled slightly starting to feel a little smitten at his bravery and how Buckbeak finally allowed him to be petted.</p><p>“Well done, oh well done yer two, oh well done!” Hagrid clapped happily as the students clapped with him. Klaus clapped loudly for his sister causing other Slytherins to hiss. “I fink he may let ‘ya ride ‘im now.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Let’s go Stormswift!”</p><p>“Elly!” Klaus shouted. "Don't you dare hurt yourself!"</p><p>"No worries!" Elly shouted back as she hoisted herself up and over Stormswift. "You've got my back, don't you boy?” She asked the hippogriff whom chirped back it her. She gave its head a short little ruffle as she pulled its feathers lightly to trot towards a now mounted Buckbeak as Harry clutched onto some feathers. “Ready Harry?”</p><p>“No?” Harry panicky replied.</p><p>“Oh. well don’t pull any of their feather’s off.” She shrugged as she patted Stormswift and leaned over and reached to wrap her arms over its neck. The hippogriffs roared as they sprinted forwards toward the vacant part of the clearing, its speed surprising her as she whooped in delight as both Stormswift and Buckbeak ascended into the skies at a breakneck speed. She laughed in joy feeling the British autumn winds whisk past her and the nostalgic feeling overcome her. She sat up again, thanking herself mentally for tying her hair back into a bun so it wouldn’t jerk behind her as they flew. Sitting up straight with arms outstretched and legs tightly clenching Stormswift’s body, she cheered letting Stormswift take control of the flying and letting her enjoy the flight she longed to feel once again since leaving Beauxbatons. The uncomfortable feel of a broomstick couldn’t compare to the freedom of soaring the airs with another living creature. She grinned down at Buckbeak and Harry whom were now flying over the Black Lake. Stormswift roared again before hovering down until the two majestic hippogriffs were at eye-level with each other. Their talons skimming the surface the lake creating ripples and spurts of water that flowed with the current.</p><p>“Come on Harry!” Elly shouted over the soaring winds. “Let go, You’re safe on them. Enjoy every little bit life throws at ya. You have already, so why not now?”</p><p>Harry stared at Elly frantically before he blinked and nodded. He slowly unclasped Buckbeak’s neck and spread his arms wide like Elly. He grabbed her hand in a trusting manner as he began to enjoy the flight with a loud cheer of his own. She laughed and squeezed his hand enthusiastically as they let go of each other and began to ride side by side. The bright smile on Harry’s face was something she was looking forward to after that horrible divination class. It was the look she forever wished to see upon her friend’s face. He cheered as Stormswift began to show off with Elly, spinning 360o and even swooping down a little to gain momentum as Elly automatically complied with Stormswift’s sense to show off.</p><p>However as quickly as it had begun did it end. The two hippogriffs began to descend back into the clearing. This was the bit Harry and Elly had been dreading; they leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, Harry feeling like he was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. The pair of hippogriffs staggered a little, circling the clearing before halting near Hagrid once more.</p><p>As Hagrid and the rest of the students began to applaud the two, Elly smoothly slipped off the back of the Hippogriffs back. With a final glance and bow between the two, Stormswift trotted away towards a dead ferret lying on the floor away from them. Elly petted Buckbeak on her way towards Harry and Hagrid as she saw the two having a somewhat private conversation. She turned towards the Hippogriff with a smile as she stared into its eagle eyes.</p><p>“You’re a good hippogriff,” She whispered towards Buckbeak whose eyes blinked in return. “Thank you for not scaring Harry too much.”</p><p>Elly giggled as Buckbeak chirped happily and jumped on its forelegs in response as she swivelled around to go back to the other students. She had barely walked 3 steps before she saw Draco, in all his arrogant and handsome glory, begin to swagger towards where she stood. However, his eyes were on Buckbeak the whole time with an envious look on his face.</p><p>“You’re not dangerous at all, are you?” Draco called towards Buckbeak arrogantly. Elly tried to push Malfoy away as he came a bit too near to the hippogriff.</p><p>“Malfoy stop,” She whispered as he tried to push by her. Her hand landed on his hard chest she tried not to show any impression on how well built his slender chest was becoming from those quidditch practices and matches.</p><p>“You great, ugly, brute,” Malfoy taunted as he stopped advancing towards Buckbeak allowing Elly’s hand to linger on his chest a little longer. He smirked down at her hand on his chest before the eruption of screams and the roar from Buckbeak caused him to jerk up in shock. Elly turned around in surprise to see Buckbeak angrily fluttering its wings. It roared again on its hindlegs, front talons ready to strike down towards the two as it eyed Malfoy in anger. In a panic, she fumbled within her robes for her wand.</p><p>She felt Draco’s arm circle her waist as she was jerked to the side, another arm protectively over the both of them as they staggered back a little in fear. She shrieked as one of Buckbeak’s talons slashed his arm and he gave a pained cry as the two fell to the ground.</p><p>“Buckbeak!” Hagrid cried as he began to calm down the angry hippogriff.</p><p>“Oh god, Malfoy!” Elly gasped as she sat up so Draco could clasp his injured arm in pain. “Can you stand up? Merlin, you’re bleeding.”</p><p>“It’s killed me! It’s killed me Aevum!” Draco moaned as he winced at the pain trying to stare up at her.</p><p>“Hagrid! They need to be taken to the hospital,” Hermione ordered.</p><p>“I’m the teacher, I’ll do it,” Hagrid panicked. He hastily picked up Draco before glancing at Elly. “Yer’ can walk, can’t ya?”</p><p>Elly only nodded in response as she followed beside them on shaky legs.</p><p>“Class dismissed,” Hagrid announced as the three began to walk towards the infirmary.</p><p>“You’re gonna regret this,” Draco moaned still weary in the arms of Hagrid, “You and your bloody chicken.”</p><p>“Hippogriff,” Elly corrected quietly.</p><p>“It’s a damn monster, look what it did to me!” Draco retorted jerking towards his injured arm evidently.</p><p>Elly remained quiet as she focused on her shaking legs. She tried to drown out the pained moans and complaints from the Slytherin as the they quickly walked towards the hospital. She had never seen a hippogriff strike like that, let alone to a student. Students at Beauxbaton were warned never to anger a hippogriff and to mind its manners at all time towards the creatures. She tried to drown out the panic screams from the students with the joy she felt flying on Stormswift not too long ago. An inkling feeling started to creep into her as her mind wandered yet again to the attack before she rationed her thoughts.</p><p>‘<em>On one hand, we were warned not to anger hippogriffs,</em>’ she thought as they ascended into the corridor where the hospital was. ‘<em>On another hand, I don’t think I can take that image of Buckbeak in all its might ready to strike not only Malfoy... but me too</em>.’</p>

  <p>Before she knew it, they were already in the hospital wing. Madame Pomfrey was both in shock and anger as Hagrid placed Malfoy on the nearest bed. The infirmary was empty, seeing as how it was only the start of the term and nobody had showed any signs of illnesses or injuries thus far. Draco moaned painfully as his injured arm came in contact with the bed beneath him. He cursed at Hagrid as he was led away with Madame Pomfrey who began to question Hagrid on what had happened privately. Elly awkwardly swayed a few feet away from Draco as she stared at his injured arm. She had purposely stayed where his good arm was afraid he may curse at her too if she came too near his arm. She grimaced as blood began to seep through the white shirt underneath his torn black robes. The deafening silence, excluding his groans, between the two was almost unbearable. He stared at her reaction of the ordeal. He watched her sapphire orbs scream caution and panic as he leaned on his good arm. Steel met sapphire once again.</p><p>“How are you feeling now?” She whispered as she edged forward hastily as if she was walking towards Buckbeak.</p><p>“Like I just got hit with an unforgivable curse,” He muttered keeping eye contact. “Sit.” He ordered.</p><p>“W-what?”</p><p>“You’re wobbling,” He analysed staring at her from head to toe. “You’re scared. Sit.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” She frowned as her legs failed to comply with her lie.</p><p>“Aevum,” He softly gritted. His eyes softening in the act as he beckoned her to come closer with a slow nod. “Sit. You might trip over your own feet.”</p><p>She felt lost in his eyes as she nodded slowly in response and took small light steps towards him. As if gravity disagreed with her light steps, she skidded over her own feet and gasped lightly ready to fall onto the bed. She felt the familiar arm encircle her waist again keeping her from falling flat. She grabbed onto the nearest things she could reach. Her right hand grabbed Draco’s good upper arm in a jolt as her left hand landed on his chest. She exhaled a shaky breath as she began to apologize to him through the robes her face was now buried in.</p><p>“Aevum,” Draco softly called down to her. “Look at me.”</p><p>Elly looked up to meet his grey eyes once more. Any form of panic she once had was slowly dissipating, she was lost in his eyes. She felt safe as the arm around her waist stayed strong around her. She lightly tugged at his arm in response as they just stared at each other once more finding comfort in each other’s eyes.</p><p>“You’re safe with me,” He promised. “Sit.”</p><p>“But-”</p><p>“Sit.” He ordered yet again, his gaze hardening. He took control, slowly manoeuvring her to sit by him, his hand trailing up to her upper back. “Don’t worry, that monster will be gone. Wait ‘til my father hears about this. He’ll be furious. So, will my mother.”</p><p>“No wait,” She pleaded twisting her body, so she was facing him. “You can’t blame Buckbeak for this.”</p><p>“Do I have to remind you it nearly tore my bloody arm off? Or that it nearly attacked you?”</p><p>“You provoked it.”</p><p>“And yet look where we both ended up. You could’ve been the one with a slashed arm. What were you thinking? Just standing there fixing your little robes?”</p><p>Elly frowned muttering a response. Draco sneered pulling her closer. She gulped as he closed the distance between them until the tips of his platinum bangs hovered over her own onyx locks. Their noses but a few breaths away and he stared once again into her wavering eyes. “Say that again, Aevum?”</p><p>“I was,” She breathed, feeling a little overwhelmed with every breath that fanned her face. “I was trying to protect you.”</p><p>He blinked. “I don’t need help.”</p><p>“And I don’t need you to help me sit. And yet look where we both ended up?” She mimicked his tone. “You may be an arrogant boy, but you’re still just a boy,” She pressed on, reasoning more to herself. “You’re still my classmate and I wouldn’t want you to get hurt.” She realized he was right. But her body moved on its own. Her instinct to defend and protect outweighed her sense of running. The adrenaline had pumped through her system like a drug and that drug was to protect the boy who had done the very thing she sought to do in a matter of seconds.</p><p>“Thanks.” His voice an octave deeper.</p><p>Never had his voice felt so solid and strong beside her. It was forced, then again when had Draco Malfoy ever said thank you? It was a rare moment that would probably be imprinted into her mind for a while. She wanted to nod in response, or back away, or do something; But she couldn’t for some unspeakable reason. All she could do was breath lightly in sync with the Slytherin whom kept his arm encircled around her. She couldn’t help but slowly lose herself in his dazzling eyes. This was the closest the two had ever been. Dare she say, it felt it to be a tad intimate too? But she couldn’t help but revel in the protection from someone as unlikely as Draco Malfoy. She could study him like this. His porcelain skin free from blemishes and his sharp features. He was probably every witches’ picture of aristocratic richness. From the way he had presented himself to his confidence in his looks, his style, his walk, his everything. She still remembered the way he had first spoken to him. Last year, when his hair was still neatly gelled back and had not experience the growth spurt. When both were still strangers whom have never crossed paths personally despite their circle of acquaintances. A good duel it was, Elly bit off more than she could chew almost losing the spar but impressed regardless by the Slytherin.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Nice moves, Aevum.” A younger Malfoy complimented as he watched her briefly duel with Pansy Parkinson. His opponent, Harry Potter, still dazed on the floor from his most recent hex which sent him flying into the suit of armour behind him. He had glanced over at Klaus to see he had no trouble at all sending hex after hex towards a poor, defenceless Ravenclaw. Then he turned to the other Aevum. The new little Gryffindor transferring from Beauxbatons. Klaus’ twin sister.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Flipendo!” Elly shouted flicking her hand upwards. Pansy shrieked, flipping backwards onto the floor a few feet away from where Millicent Bullstrode and Hermione were clawing at each other. “I’m sorry, who are you?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco. Draco Malfoy.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Mal foi?” She teased glancing down at his emerald green tie and emblem. “Quite an interesting surname you have there. Bad faith, it means. Does it describe you well?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“How dare you disgrace my family’s name like that,” Draco spat. He practically sprinted towards Pansy, whispering to her to take over and torture Potter for a bit, before turning towards the girl who was already in her duelling stance. A stance oddly familiar to that of muggle fencing. “You’ll pay for that Aevum. Not even your brother will be able to stop me.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh! I do love a good duel against worthy opponents,” She called. “En Garde! I’m putting my faith in you. Prove me wrong Mal Foi.”</em>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Unbeknownst to Elly, Draco scanned her from head to torso. His grip on her never wavering as he analysed her. The way her softly shaped eyebrows furrowed and the few strands that shaped her soft face; and small pubescent spots that were covered with concealer but the overall soft, fair complexion. The smooth lips that shined a little with whatever lip care she used. The way her sapphire eyes looked like a galaxy in itself. And the sweet, cotton scent of her perfume that wafted and intermingled with his own leathery cologne. He took it all in. Knowing that moments like this with a girl like Aevum, with a Gryffindor in general, were rare. He took in the minty breath that exhaled from her lips. He was sure his breath smelt like apples and mint. Anyone could walk in at any minute to see them in the compromising position. A Gryffindor and a Slytherin in each other’s arms. And yet, it all just felt right. He believed it was right.</p><p>But he was wrong.</p><p>She blinked away her memories as she realized now just how intimate their position was. For a boy and girl no older than 13 looking like they were cuddling in the infirmary, not to mention their houses’ rivalry, the rivalry between their friends, and Parkinson’s claims that she and the boy whose arm was around her were an item; she realized how dangerous this all felt. How wrong it was to feel protected in a ‘taken’-stranger’s arms and how conniving he could be. How he could twist whatever moment had just come between them. She didn’t want to be roped into any rumours nor did she want to trouble her brother should this information fall on eavesdroppers. The rationale side of her brain trying to stay in power but her uncertainties on the blonde bombshell clouded her judgement. Her senses finally caught up to reality. Time waits for no-one. She wiggled out of his grip.</p><p>He grimaced at the lost. And so did she.</p><p>“Thank you.” Elly said standing up, feeling a little better than before because of him. Because of him. “Thank you for protecting me.”</p><p>“I’d do it all again,” <em>for you</em>. The words trapped in Draco’s throat as he coughed slightly leaning back onto his good arm.</p><p>She blinked at his reply. “Pardon?”</p><p>“I’d do it all again,” He repeated.</p>

  <p>“Miss Aevum, are you sure you’re feeling alright? You’re welcome to stay for the night, my dear,” Madame Pomfrey called from the opposite side of the infirmary.</p>
<p>“I’m feeling better now, Thank you Madame Pomfrey.” Elly replied politely as she made her way to the exit. “Thank you for the hospitality.”</p>
<p>In truth, Elly didn’t want to stay a second longer. It was uncomfortable. After the two had ceased their conversation Elly transferred to a different bed to rest while Madame Pomfrey tended to his injured arm. After an hour (or was it two?) of sleep, she awoke and watched from afar as Draco winced like a baby and cringed from the sight of his once-perfect skin defiled by the 3 slashes across his arm. Thankfully Madame Pomfrey has an endless stock of ditanny ready for students.</p>
<p>She trotted upstairs back to her common room. She had missed the rest of her classes for the day. She’d need Hermione to catch up with everything and reply to Rose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“There’s our little Elly!” The devious duo of Fred and George Weasley greeted her with the usual group hug. She laughed lightly hugging them tighter. She let them lead her to one of the sofa’s next to the fireplace.</p>
<p>“You didn’t get hurt, did you?”</p>
<p>“You made sure Malfoy got the full blow from the hippogriff, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, honestly boys. That’s quite rude to say,” Hermione muttered pulling her away from the twins.</p>
<p>“But you know, you want him to get hurt- “George began.</p>
<p>“Even if your goody-two-shoes self denies it. We all want him to get passed around like a punching bag,” Fred finished.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s one way of defining people’s thoughts on Malfoy,” Elly chimed. “Still I’m fine, just needed a little rest after that. ‘Mione? Mind helping me catch up?”</p>
<p>Hermione’s face brightened. “Of course! We can begin all the homework that’s due in soon.”</p>
<p>“And…When are they due?”</p>
<p>“In about 2 weeks.”</p>
<p>“That’s not soon!”</p>
<p>“Did you expect anything less?” Ron sighed as he joined all of them sitting on the floor underneath George. “By the way, we took your bag in. Hermione’s thrown it on your bed.”</p>
<p>“Incorrect Ron, I neatly placed your belongings onto your bed Elly. Don’t listen to him.”</p>
<p>“Right, and you were speaking calmly and considerately about Malfoy provoking the bird?”</p>
<p>“Hippogriff! Ron, Hippogriff!”</p>
<p>“Aha! So, you don’t deny throwing her stuff then?”</p>
<p>“What? Of course, I deny it, you imbecile- “</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The twins and Elly stared back and forth between the somewhat-calm argument between the two Gryffindors. With Ron’s quip and Hermione’s eloquence, it was quite a sight that they never even noticed Harry take a seat next to Ron, which was in front of Elly. Subconsciously, she began to pet his head, which really needed a haircut.</p>
<p>“They’re already at post-honeymoon arguments,” Fred sighed.</p>
<p>“How long have they been at it?” Harry asked leaning into Elly’s petting.</p>
<p>“Not too long now but- “Elly began.</p>
<p>“They’ll soon be talking about pets- “George continued.</p>
<p>“And end with your unceremonious entrance-” Fred carried on.</p>
<p>“Possibly continue to debate and involve the three of us-”</p>
<p>“By that point Fred and I would be off pranking and you two- “</p>
<p>“Could dissolve their banter like the cute little quartet you guys are.”</p>
<p>“How are you finishing each other’s sentences? You’re not even related to them, Elly,” Harry questioned turning back to the three of them.</p>
<p>George, Fred and Elly looked at each other with a knowing smile. “Twin telepathy,” They replied in unison.</p>
<p>“Klaus and I do it,” Elly furthered her explanation, “When nobody’s around of course. Being around someone for so long, you can predict what would be on their mind. And being with these troublesome two have taught me a lot. Remember, I was inseparable from them last year to the point I had an inkling when one of them had ditched. I wish Klaus would do it with me more often, spook some of the students a little.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” The twins asked. “It’s fun.”</p>
<p>“Klaus is anything but fun. His idea of ‘fun’ is whipping out his wand and thrashing the nearest person.”</p>
<p>“My my, that sounds- “</p>
<p>“Quite erotic.”</p>
<p>“Elly swap places with me.” Harry rolled his eyes as he saw her beady sapphires widen at the insinuation. The twins roared with laughter, slapping their knees with heads tossed back as Elly quickly slid onto the floor next to a still quippy Ron arguing with Hermione. “You tossers.”</p>
<p>“We love you really Elly,” The twins said calming themselves.</p>
<p>“I’ll love you in return if someone can pass me a quill and parchment.” Elly rolled her eyes as she leaned on somebody’s leg. Whose it was? She didn’t know. Possibly Harry or Fred? But she couldn’t be bothered to check whom it was.</p>
<p>“Go through my bag.” Harry shrugged as he focused on his best friend’s arguments.</p>
<p>She thanked him before digging through his bag for his quill, ink pot and a spare parchment. Outstretching her legs and getting comfortable, she straightened out the parchment and began her reply to Rose.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p><em>‘Double potions should not exist on a Friday,</em>’ Elly thought with a permanent grimace on her usually care-free face. Lunch was not enough to cheer her up from her awful morning. Double potions with Professor Snape and the Slytherins. How worse can it get? Oh, of course, Snape had it a tad harsh on non-Slytherins. He had a habit of targeting the twins whenever they were together. Not so much like Harry and Neville, poor Neville, but still quite more than the other students. Although Klaus never got the harsh treatment, probably due to his house, He still threw questions after question at the twins, with Klaus answering all of them easily. And Elly? Well, let’s just say when she loses house points, its always because of potions. <em>‘Double potions on a Friday morning should not exist, so why does it exist?’</em></p><p>“Because you’re bad at it.” A voice spoke on her mental-behalf. Klaus wrapped an arm around her as they began to make their way to DADA. “You nearly messed up again earlier. Sure, you’re feeling alright Elly? I feel like you should have stayed overnight like Malfoy.”</p><p>“Positive, it wasn’t a mind breaking experience. The Cornish pixies last year were worse.” She shuddered remembering the lightning blue imps causing havoc to anyone or anything in the DADA room. And that useless Professor with the gorgeous smile. What was his name again? Locker? Something like that? She forgot his name like he forgot his whole identity. Absolutely useless.</p><p>“Think the new DADA teacher is good enough?” Klaus asked manoeuvring her through the crowds of students off to their respective classes. They swivelled through the halls already use to the stares from younger students. The way they pointed at the two from opposing houses had little-to-no effect on her now having suffered enough of the stares last year.</p><p>“He looks familiar,” She thought aloud. “I’m sure I’ve seen him somewhere before. Perhaps mama knows about him? She did go to Hogwarts. I’ll owl her later. I do need to ask her about visiting Rose, so I’ll kill two birds with one stone. I’ll make sure to add your name somewhere in the letter too,”</p><p>“Thanks for letting me laze a little more later,” He grinned lazily. “Quidditch try-outs tomorrow, gotta be well rested for them.”</p><p>“Good luck. Do you even need luck at this point in time?”</p><p>“Not at all. You’re my lucky little charm,” He kissed her forehead before bidding her goodbye to join the few Slytherins who were in the classroom already.</p><p>DADA with the Slytherins. Disastrous.</p><p>She walked over to Lavender and Parvati, both eyeing her twin brother, before turning towards her with an array of topics to discuss from <em>‘Do you think DADA will be an utter failure again this year?’ ‘Have you seen how frail the teacher looks?’, ‘Where are all the students?’</em> to <em>‘Your brother is hot, Elly’ ‘What does he like to eat at Honeydukes?’</em> and even <em>‘Would he go to Madame Puttifoot’s with me?’</em></p><p>Elly blinked, apologized, laughed, and waltzed away laughing. She was soon approached by Harry and Ron.</p><p>“What happened?” Harry asked as her laugh began to subside.</p><p>“And why are Lavender and Parvati glaring at you?”</p><p>“I did my brother a favour and turned them down for him. He’ll thank me one day. If he ever finds out.”</p><p>“Thank you for what, Elly?”</p><p>Elly spun around to see Klaus accompanied by Malfoy’s gang. Oh.</p><p>“Thank me for breaking more hearts for you. That’s all.” She grinned.</p><p>“Oh?” Klaus raised his eyebrows. “What if I did want something with them?”</p><p>“Then you’re awfully cruel to lead on not only girls from my house but that pretty little girl you were whispering sweet nothings to,” She winked towards the Slytherin girl across the room. The stranger blinked, shrugging in reply before continuing her conversation with a fellow Slytherin.</p><p>“Well that was unexpected…” Ron blinked.</p><p>“Aevum,” Draco chimed in placing his good arm on Klaus’ shoulder. “Tell me who and I’ll put in a good name for you. All of the Slytherins respect me.” Draco eyed the scarlet trio before stopping on her. “I can get you anyone you want like I always get what I want, Aevum.”</p><p>Whether it was directed to her or her brother she didn’t know. But the implications were there. And it didn’t take a genius to know the tension that slowly brewed among them. The way Ron and Harry both took a small step forward and the way Draco’s eyes glowed excitedly at their threatening stance. Like a gambler betting his whole life on a round of Poker. And while everyone berated his move, ready to 1-up him, he did it first. He knew he was going to win anyway. He always had the winning hand.</p><p>“The offers always there, Aevum” Draco mused giving a small pat to Klaus before returning to Pansy Parkinson, whom up until now had been glaring daggers at the trio, and threw his good arm around her shoulder. So much for leading girls on and whispering sweet nothings to another.</p><p>“Hypocrite,” Klaus sighed annoyed.</p><p>“Hypocrite,” Harry repeated in a similar tone. “Hypocritical, vindictive tosser, Malfoy is.”</p><p>Klaus cocked his head at Harry in amusement. Harry only rolled his eyes at him and nudged toward the blonde. With a small laugh, Klaus patted Harry’s shoulder. “Well what do you know, Maybe you’re not that big of an idiot after all.”</p><p>“And you’re not half-bad, Aevum.”</p><p>“I’ll take that half, Potter.”</p><p>Ron and Elly looked once at each other in marvel. Never in their years would they see Klaus Aevum, Slytherin’s quiet little pretty boy, initiating a conversation with Harry Potter. Now, don’t take this the wrong way, but if it were not for Elly, the two would never cross paths. They both had no reason to talk to each other. So, to see the two conversating like any classmates would do was more than a surprise. Even Dean and Seamus glanced over in shock at the two boys conversating.</p><p>“See you around,” Klaus waved at Harry before standing next to the Slytherin girl once more almost immediately whispering ‘sweet nothings’ to each other.</p><p>‘Cute,’ Elly thought. Elly smiled as the girl caught her wandering eyes. A small nod and traces of a smile etched on her face in reply.</p><p> </p><p>The tatty old wardrobe was at the front of the classroom. Tatty like Professor Lupin’s robes. It rattled and shook begging to fall and unleash some form of chaos on the students. The dirty mirror reflecting a foggy cloud array of feared, curious and excited faces. The dark brown wardrobe shook fiercely, as if it sensed the rise of emotions from the students. It wobbled on its scratched legs and banged on the door like a deranged, caged creature.</p><p>“Intriguing isn’t it?” Professor Lupin said. “Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?”</p><p>“That’s a boggart,” Dean answered.</p><p>“Very good, Mr Thomas, and can anyone tell me what a boggart looks like?”</p><p>“No-one knows,” Elly jumped as Hermione answered. She was sure when she had glanced that way, she saw Ron. And now Hermione has graced her with her presence. Never a boring day in Hogwarts.</p><p>“When did you get here?” Elly whispered more frightened of Hermione’s sudden jump scare than the rattling wardrobe in front of her.</p><p>She blinked as Hermione gave her a once-over before continuing her explanation. “Boggarts are shapeshifters. They take the shape of whatever particular person feels the most. That’s what makes them so- “</p><p>“So terrifying, yes yes,” Professor Lupin finished walking towards the front of the room. “Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. Let’s practice it now, without wands please. After me, Ridikkulus.”</p><p>“Ridikkulus,” The class repeated.</p><p>“Very good, a little louder and very clear. Listen. Ri-di-KULL-lus.”</p><p>“Ridikkulus!”</p><p>“This class is Ridikullus,” Elly heard Draco mutter.</p><p>“You’re being Ridikullus,” She scoffed towards him.</p><p>“Leave her, Crabbe,” Draco said towards Crabbe. Crabbe stepped down. Draco silently stepped forward towards her. “Look who’s talking, hanging around mudbloods and blood traitors alike. I’ll say it again, you would be better off in Slytherin, better off with me.”</p><p>Hermione pulled her back towards her muttering nonsense about he’s not worth any time in the world.</p><p>“Why must he be so weird?” She sighed before turning back to see the Boggart stepping out as none other than Professor Snape. Neville’s fear was professor Snape. Bless his pure soul.</p><p>“Ridikullus!” Neville shouted.</p><p>Elly and Hermione howled with laughter. Now her Friday morning blues had diminished. In the form of Professor Snape wearing the most atrocious snot green attire she had ever seen in her life. His fishnet gloves held the only cute accessory he had, a red handbag, and he sported fake animals lining the collar of his blazer and an odd, flopping bird topped on his knit top hat. She could probably die happily if this was the last thing she saw.</p><p>“Wonderful, Neville, incredible. Now to the back now. Everyone form a line!” Professor Lupin announced as all the Gryffindors ran into a messy line. Everyone except Elly whom darted towards her brother and the Slytherin girl.</p><p>“Not feeling to face your fears?” Klaus teased as Elly hopped onto a short desk behind them.</p><p>“More like I don’t want to expose my fears to friends and foes alike,” She replied curtly watching the boggart get ridiculed and moulded into a new person’s fear.</p><p>“That’s a cunning way to explain you’re scared of facing it,” The girl smirked. “I don’t think we’ve met. The names Daphne Greengrass.”</p><p>“Ellyanna Aevum,” She replied promptly. “So why aren’t you lining up?”</p><p>Daphne snorted as Seamus transformed the banshee-boggart into one without its deadly screech. She stepped closer to her, taking Klaus’ space whom now went over to Malfoy’s gang to snigger at all the demonstrations. “Do you see any Slytherin’s lining up? Maybe it’s a pride thing. But, like you, I’d rather not expose my deepest fears.”</p><p>“In other words, you’re scared of facing it? Touché,” Elly mused laughing a little at Ron ridiculing the spider into one that had roller skates on every limb struggling to stand up straight.</p><p>“What is your fear?” Daphne asked quietly. “You Aevum’s haven’t showed an inkling of fear since you both stepped foot here. A basilisk on the loose? As long as you both had each other, you appeared fine. A new school? As long as you two were together, you strode on like you both attended here from the start. A hippogriff ready to strike you and Malfoy? Oh sure, lemme just mess around with my robes a sec for my wand, my brother is in the background so everything is fine. You haven’t really shown fear. So, what is it? I’m curious, what do you fear?”</p><p><em>‘What do you fear?’</em> She thought to herself. Pondering Daphne’s question. It was wrong to ponder her fears in the presence of a boggart. But she was curious. What did she fear? Or was it better to ask, what did she fear the most?</p><p>The basilisk did scare her. More than her first day Hogwarts. Yet both equal a substantial fear she once had in that moment of time. The escaped prisoner who, according to Harry, was coming after him? Did she fear for his life? She did. Did she fear for her own? She did. But it didn’t fear her the most.</p><p>It hit her. Her eyes shifted from the boggart to her brother; His sapphire orbs gleaming as he watched each student subdue the boggart into a ridiculous state. He patted Draco’s good arm as the two sniggered together. She feared for his life, and for Draco’s life, when the hippogriff attacked the two; For Harry’s life who was always in Danger; For Hermione’s life, for her ridiculously high expectations in terms of her grades; For Ron’s life, who never wanted to be overshadowed despite his many siblings and his lack of wealth compared to others.;For her own life, where she feared for everyone. She feared fear. She never wanted to live in a life of fear, and with her protective brother, she was always free from fear. But a life so free from fear was impossible, she would always fear fear. She would fear the dementors would feed on her fear of all fears.</p><p>“Fear in the name only increases fear in itself,” She whispered as she watched Harry take on the boggart. Or tried to.</p><p>The boggart had morphed again. Turning into the pale, sickly form of a dementor that hovered above Hogwarts grounds. It hovered closer and closer to Harry… Yet it’s face directed at her. She gasped, ready to hop down and subdue the boggart when Professor Lupin skidded in front of Harry.</p><p>“HERE!” He screamed gaining back its attention. The room watched as the boggart could do nothing but morph again into its latest target’s fear. And Professor Lupin’s fear was odd. A crystal orb that hovered in a haze. Its pale white gleam hauntingly beautiful. He subdued the beast trapping back into the wardrobe with a tired huff. With a wave, Professor Lupin dismissed the class. Students who never had a turn, groaned before trudging to get their backpacks.</p><p>“Wow.” Daphne smirked. The two grabbed their bags and waited for majority of the students to head out. “You really are a Gryffindor, though whether you're truly brave or a fool is still be determined. There's a fine line between bravery and foolishness, Aevum. Ready to run at that boggart like that. So, you fear dementors?”</p><p>“No, actually I- “</p><p>“Watch out, Aevum! A dementor!” A shrilly voice shrieked at her causing her to jump. The cackle from Pansy Parkinson was nothing anyone should ever hear in their life. But she’s heard it way too many times. “I can’t believe you and Potter fear dementors that much. God I can’t wait to use this against you for the rest of your life.”</p><p>God, she hated Parkinson. Ever since she first stepped into Hogwarts, the girl had begun to hate her. From petty little arguments to catfights, the two have gone through it. It wasn’t even a house rivalry that was the cause of their fights. It was something else, something Elly and Parkinson both secretly agreed to disagree on. Elly rolled her eyes. “I can’t believe your stuck with that annoying voice for the rest of your life.”</p><p>“Why you little prat.” She sneered wrinkling her nose. “Why don’t you go to Beauxbatons where you belong?”</p><p>“Why don’t you go back to the Magical Menagerie where you belong?” Elly snapped. “I suppose its best that you escaped that pet shop. Like anyone would buy you after giving you one glance anyway.”</p><p>“Elly!” Klaus warned as he approached his little sister surrounded by the female Slytherins. “That’s enough.”</p><p>“No, no, carry on,” Daphne egged on. “She sounds a lot like you right now, this is exciting to see. The little lion is ready to pounce again.”</p><p>“She had it coming. With her pug face, shrilly voice and awful personality. What a terrible trio to be born with.” Elly mocked.</p><p>Pansy could only shriek. She eyed professor Lupin, whom ‘til now only watched their verbal dispute, before growling lowly at her. “You watch your back Aevum. Your precious brother won’t always be there for you.”</p><p>“You watch yourself too, Parkinson. I don’t need my brother to protect me, but I know you need Malfoy to protect you. That is, if he really does want to protect you.”</p><p>"Atleast I do have him," Pansy scoffed, pushing her so hard she knocked her bag off her shoulder. Books and parchments scattered the floor only to be stomped on. </p><p>Elly glared, spewing a couple of colourful words at her before advancing towards the receding Slytherin. It took both Klaus and Daphne to hold her back from exiting the room.</p><p>“Miss Aevum.”</p><p>“What?” She snapped only to regret it as Professor Lupin looked bemusedly down at her.</p><p>“A word alone?”</p><p>“Sir, you saw what Parkinson did- “Klaus began to explain</p><p>“She’s not in trouble. Now will you two please leave?”</p><p>The two glanced back at each other before letting go of Elly. She huffed, muttering ‘thanks’ before bidding them goodbye. Klaus kissed her forehead tenderly before shutting the door to the classroom.</p>

  <p>“Your temper. Quite a spark you have there, Miss Aevum, most likely from your Father I presume?” Professor Lupin began his talk with her. “Perhaps you can help me return these desks to their original places than have a detention for your interesting choice of words.”</p><p>“Right, Professor,” She said as she whipped out her hand. With a swish and a flick, she whispered ‘<em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>’ on one of the desks. “Professor, I wanted to ask about the dementor earlier.”</p><p>“You’re wondering why it sought after Mr Potter yet stared at you. You wanted to know why I stopped that boggart. You want to know what it all means, am I correct?” He replied as he levitated yet another desk in the air. “I would have thought it would be obvious. I assumed, judging from Mr Potter’s background, it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. It would appear, although you and Mr Potter are two different people, you both share the same fear. Should you have had a different fear, the boggart would have morphed into a mix of your fears. I’m quite impressed with the outcome either way, it would appear that what you both fear the most is fear itself. Very wise.”</p><p>“That sort of makes sense? I guess I would rather have it morph into a dementor than that unattractive person,” She cringed almost losing concentration on her spell. “I’m surprised you are not afraid to say his name.”</p><p>Professor Lupin chuckled, “Fear in the name only increases- “</p><p>“Fear in itself,” She interrupted dropping the desk in its rightful place. She turned around to see a proud smile etched on Professor Lupin’s face. “How do you know that phrase?”</p><p>“A wise, old headmaster once told that to a bright, young witch,” He explained walking towards the record player. “Your mother, Miss Aevum, Iris once told me that.”</p><p>She snapped her fingers and sat on top a random desk. “I knew you looked familiar, you were in one of her old albums from her wedding day!”</p><p>She recalled the memory as clear as she can remember. A young 8-year old Elly sitting beside her mother. Her dark hair tied into a ponytail much like her mother and their sapphire eyes giggling through the many photos she had. Her legs swung giddily as her mother skimmed over each photo. Each one moving in one way or another. She remembered always going through her wedding photos. Each one as beautiful as the next.</p><p>Iris and Henry Aevum had their wedding in a forest clearing. Whether it was in France or the United Kingdom was unclear, but that didn’t matter for it looked ethereal in the vintage prints. The forest clearing was scattered with petals that swayed in the soft breeze. The guests dressed to the nines in elegant robes and dresses alike. Her younger self excitingly expressing how she wanted a wedding much like that. Iris would chuckle, petting her head with her free hand, as she spoke to her younger self. Then Elly would point to her favourite photo. A photo of Iris and Henry alone. Her neatly braided bun decorated with a leaf headband. She wore a long flowy, sleeveless gown. The simple wedding band gleamed in the sunlight. She kissed it before staring lovingly at Henry. And Henry, how dashing her father looked wearing a fitted suit and bowtie never once stared at the camera. His eyes solely on Iris the whole time. His warm smile growing bigger as their eyes connected. She loved that photo the most.</p><p>She recalled pointing to a photo of Iris and a group of adults whom all smiled and waved towards the camera. A bunch of faces she did not recognize at all. The one Professor Lupin was a part of. His younger complexion a contrast to his face now as he stood near the middle. Beside a shaggily warmed face young man and a bespectacled gentleman.</p><p>“That’s right, Miss Aevum. You and your brother are both strikingly identical to her. Iris was a brilliant student. Very emotionally involved in everything she did. Never the first to initiate a conversation but always the first to bark and snap only when she sees those precious to her involved. Even on her wedding day, she almost attacked us all with her wedding cake when we recited our speeches for her. Not one for sappy speeches,” He laughed to himself. “She was loved, and she made sure we were loved too. Her devotion got my friend and I through our darkest times. I assume she has not spoken much of her friends at Hogwarts?”</p><p>She shook her head slowly, confused at it all. Never in her 13 years had she met a friend of Iris from her teen years. She thought for a second. Never had she really asked about her mother’s friends. Nor about her history.</p><p>“That was to be expected.”</p><p>“Did something happen? She has never spoken about her time at Hogwarts to me. Only that she considers Hogwarts her home. That’s why she opted I school with Klaus rather than stay in France when she rarely came home. It didn’t take that much persuasion for me to agree.”</p><p>“No, of course not. Perhaps you are not asking the right question, Miss Aevum.” Professor Lupin concluded with a we-will-be-changing-the-topic smile. “Now then, I fear I may not have enough time to explain it all to you. It seems we got carried away with reminiscing of the past. I hope you will be able to make it to your next class. If you have one, that is.”</p><p>“Oh?” She frantically looked around for a clock. Then she looked above to see its hand moving but an inch to the right. 1:56 PM. “Crap, Arithmancy. I’m sorry Professor. I have to run.”</p><p>“Not to worry dear, I apologize for keeping you a tad longer than expected,” He waved his hand dismissively, “Do greet your mother and father for me. I believe they are both out of the country?”</p><p>“Yes sir. Mama works in the Ministre des Affaires Magiques de la France while papa is travelling the world,” She explained getting ready to leave. “I shall be sure to greet them for you, Professor. Good day.”</p><p>“Good day, Miss Aevum.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Arithmancy was an interesting subject.</p><p><em>One</em> full of modern day mysteries and future predictions.</p><p><em>Two</em> different sets of numbers each bordering their own way of predicting the outcomes.</p><p><em>Three</em> different reactions as the black velvet Gryffindor rushed through the door spewing a lame apology for her tardiness. Shock, Amusement, Curiosity.</p><p><em>Four</em> rows down and Elly is forced to sit on the only vacant seat left available, next to Draco Malfoy.<br/> I believe this was the <em>Fifth</em> time their eyes met that very same day.</p><p>Shock was Elly’s reaction for the small class, the stern and disapproving look from her Arithmancy professor, Septima Vector, and the sight of Draco Malfoy in all his pompous glory with the only vacant seat in the corner of the row. Shock was her reaction to his amused gaze that never left her body as she slowly eased her way towards the vacant seat. Shocked was the reaction she gave to Hermione, seated in the front row next to an unknown Ravenclaw. Yet when she turned back, his eyes still followed her. Like a snake tracing the steps of a defenceless animal. Her small wobble into the seat caught by his grey eyes, his expression unwavering, not even a signature flick of his eyebrows. She waited for him to mock her, smirk, scoff, something. It never came. But the ringing voice of Professor Vector’s voice distracted her from her former shock. She dipped her quill into her ink pot and began to take as many notes as she could.</p><p>Amused was the Slytherin. Amused… and annoyed; having been given an earful from Pansy about her little tiff with the lion. The defensive lost little lion when she wasn’t with her brother. How amusing, how did she get placed in Gryffindor of all places? Full of boisterous mudbloods and blood traitors alike. He was not present when the tiff occurred, though now he wished he was. The little lion finally letting out another soft purr, that would have been a moment to rouse her onwards, break her away from the chain she’s wrapped tightly around her brother, in the safety of her brother’s protection. What an amusing little life she lived. A pitiful safe-haven. How amusing would it be to break into her sanctuary? How proud would it be to be the reason her purrs finally became roars she, herself, can be proud of? How amusing would it all be?</p><p>Curious was Hermione’s reaction. Her inkpot placed specifically further than she would like to use its clean reflection to observe the two in the back. Balancing Professor Vector’s fast paced discussion, taking notes and observing the two were a simple task to her. She’s been doing it for years now, with her adept senses and her insanely intelligent mind, adding a little extra task wouldn’t be a big deal. The way the two stayed hush in the back, the way he paid no attention to the lesson and gave his undivided attention to her while she stopped every so often to stare directly at him. She was curious to know what was going on between them, behind all the students, beyond the boundary of their house rivalry.</p><p> </p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Will you stop acting like Granger and answer my question now, Aevum?” Draco whispered nudging the girl yet again. “Tell me what you did to Pansy, you got her riled up like a damn banshee.”</p><p>She cursed under her breath. Her parchment was full of ink smudges, letters that stroked out in all different directions and a few extra doodles on the side of her parchment, courtesy of Draco Malfoy snatching her quill and doodling before she snatched it back. A moment of silence for her tattered notes. She hoped Hermione had gotten most notes written so they could possibly review it later. Because right now, she wasn’t getting any information in her brain while she sat next to the annoying Slytherin. How do people sit next to this boy and still pass their exams? She prayed he wouldn’t be like this for the rest of the year. It was only the first lesson.</p><p>“Oi, I’m talking to you.”</p><p>“For Godric’s sake, shut up,” She finally whispered back. Her eyes snapping up to meet his for the umpteenth time. “I just had a small talk with her.”</p><p>Draco chortled, ignoring the sharp stare the Professor casted at him, and nudged her once again for good measures. “Oh, so humble you Aevums’ are. Be honest. Be proud. Say it was a rouse, a fight, a tiff, beef, a test of two tempers, a bloody argument.”</p><p>“Well you seem to know what happened.”</p><p>“Tell me more.”</p><p>“Tell me what she was saying about specific numbers.” She challenged seeing his blank parchment next to her poor excuse of scribbled notes and messy markings.</p><p>“You’ve got your character number, a number made from your name,” He began confidently. “A number that can be calculated to predict your hopes, your personality, your desires, your fears. The heart number is calculated using the vowels in your name whilst the social number uses your consonants. Need I say more?”</p><p>“I’m impressed,” She hummed noting down all that he’s said so far. “Not one dip into your ink pot and you’ve already got the whole lesson memorized. May I enquire how you know all of this?”</p><p>“May I remind you who got some of the best marks in their exams 2 years in the row?”</p><p>“Hermione?”</p><p>She dipped her quill into the ink once again as she calculated her own numbers. <em>2. 7. 4.</em> Though they meant very little to her without skimming through the chapter in the book. Something she should have done last night had it not been for the Weasley twins conversating with her through the night about their upcoming pranks for the term. She pursed her lips, underlining the 2. Perhaps it would represent her and her brother in a strange mysterious way? Unbeknownst to her, the desk had become awfully quiet. And the brooding aura from the Malfoy was an obvious sign that there was something wrong. His once amused eyes now glowered menacingly at her. His fist slightly clenching.</p><p>“Are you bloody serious?” He sneered. “I got some of the best marks. I didn’t expect you to be one of those biased Gryffindors.”</p><p>“I’m not wrong. And I don’t want to be the one to feed your ego, get your girlfriend to do it.”</p><p>“Hn, girlfriend?” He muttered. “Gryffindorks and their nonsense.”</p><p>“Just because I’m right?” She finally looked towards him to see he was pretending to write on his parchment. His eyes now burning holes into the tan paper. “Hey, answer me. You’re lucky you have no ink on that quill.”</p><p>“Why should I answer an ignorant girl like you?”</p><p>Elly sighed dramatically, a sigh that attracted the eyes of her classmates and the teacher who only raised her voice louder. She ran a hand through her hair as she leaned away from him slightly and study his stubborn highness. “I never said you weren’t smart. But Hermione was the best. Admit it. You’re brilliant outta the lads. Hermione is the best witch.”</p><p>He tutted in reply as he stared up at Professor Vector as if he finally paying attention 10 minutes before the lesson ended. “Flattery gets you nowhere, Aevum.”</p><p>“My my, Is Draco mad at me?” She teased watching him glance as she called his name. She watched the smirk trying to creep onto his lips and his side profile lose its tenseness. She had to admit, his side profile was just as good as his front profile. So sharp and neat, not a hair out of place. She couldn’t stop the small smitten smile from creeping onto her own lips. She poked him again once. Twice. Thrice. Before he finally let out a low chuckle that tingled her spine and heightened her senses. A low, soft and mellow sound that chimed so beautifully in that one moment.</p><p>“You should say that more often.”</p><p>“What?” She asked cocking her head to the side. Her senses anticipating another melodic chuckle, one that would never come. Only to be replaced with something else.</p><p>“My name,” He replied mimicking her posture except with his head resting on his good arm. “It sounds pleasant from your lips. Pretty pleasant. Say it again for me, Ellyanna?”</p><p><em>Merlin.</em> Even her own name sounded like a melody from his lips.</p><p>Elly blinked twice. Her face flushing a soft pink that was barely noticeable unless they were a short distance from her like Malfoy. She huffed, caught off guard by his sudden change in tone. “Don’t you have a girlfriend? Flattery gets you nowhere, Malfoy.”</p><p>“My my, Is Ellyanna blushing?”</p>

  <p>“Ellyanna Aevum, you tell me what you were discussing right now before I whip up a batch of veritaserum just to use on you,” Hermione said.</p><p>As much as she did not want to be here, she had to be. There the two girls sat in the courtyard. Their parchments spread on the bench they used as a makeshift desk and their hairs tied in buns ready to crack on with some work. Though the duo would rather be in the library, it was far too packed with no seats for the pair. With the autumn sun still out, ready to greet dusk like an old friend, the two decided to sit and conversate here. Alone. Without wandering eyes and fading glances to irk them. Elly sat on the floor with her legs folded as Hermione opted to sit on the bench and hunch over to continue her work.</p><p>“Shouldn’t we discuss other things first ‘Mione?” She asked trying to avoid the topic as much as possible. “Like how you appear out of nowhere, or Harry’s problem? Or Buckbeak? Or the upcoming Hogsmeade trip?”</p><p>“Priorities.” She replied curtly.</p><p>Elly blinked. “Since when did Malfoy become a priority?”</p><p>“Well, he’s not- “</p><p>“Exactly! So, we should discuss you first. Priorities, right?”</p><p>“Oh, Elly- “</p><p>“I’m just saying,” She interrupted hotly. “You appearing out of nowhere is quite disturbing even in this magical world.”</p><p>“So is the fact you and Malfoy are getting along.” Hermione retorted noticing the young blue-eyed Gryffindor roll her eyes. She straightened out her skirt after feeling a chill roll by and redid her hair into a very messy and bushy bun. “Listen, you have to swear not to tell anyone about this. Professor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore swore that I was not to tell anyone, but with Harry and Ron’s sudden outbursts, its getting more and more annoying to see their astonished faces,” Hermione began with a deep breath. She then dropped her quill and fumbled inside until she found the trinket once again showing it to the curious girl. The trinket was off-coloured. Rusty. A rustic gold-plated sand hourglass that was encased by 2 rings and a strange quote engraved on the outer ring.</p><p>"<em>I mark the hours, everyone, Nor have I yet outrun the Sun. My use a value, unto you, Are gauged by what you have to do.</em>" Elly read rotating the trinket around. “What an interesting phrase.”</p><p>“It’s a time-turner Elly,” Hermione whispered. “They gave it to me at the start of term. Its how I get to all of my classes. The ministry approved it of course, no need for that look. I may be a genius, but I could never create something as intricate as this.”</p><p>“Amazing. Can I use it to get an extra hour of sleep?”</p><p>“You most certainly cannot,” She snatched the time turner off her before shoving back into her robes. “These are very dangerous tools Elly. You could alternate reality doing something as miniscule as napping. Time is such a dangerous and unforgiveable aspect in our world. Time waits for no-one.”</p><p>“Tempus neminem manet.” Elly replied with a distant smile.</p><p>“You say that a lot, what does it mean?” Hermione asked as she watched the sunset.</p><p>“Time waits for no-one.” Elly replied as she propped herself next to Hermione to watch the sunset. “It’s the motto of my family, the Aevum’s. Ironic as Aevum means age or 'an age of time' in Latin. We age as time goes by. Although some parts of my family, especially my mother’s side, have been able to withstand the tests of time. Longevity you see. I know a great, great uncle who died at the age of 103. ”</p><p>“Incredible,” Hermione gasped. “I never knew that about your family.”</p><p>“You never really asked. I don’t like to delve too deep into my family’s histories. Mainly because we like our isolation. My families’ history isn’t one I know much about but what I do know is we like to be secretive.”</p><p>“You can say that again. You and Klaus are pretty secretive when you look at it at a perspective. You tend to stay close together in your own little circle. I mean, Fred and George do that too but they’re a little more open than you two are. And when you two are apart, you guys slowly open more. It’s like when you two are together, it’s just you two against the world.”</p><p>Elly nodded in reply. She was right. Klaus and Elly liked their isolated world. Where danger can lurk at any moment. And with the knowledge they had, they could protect each other and each other alone, together. She knew one day that world will shatter the moment they meet their significant others. But right now, in this day and time, they had nobody but each other until they are reunited with their parents once more during the holidays. And it had always been like that from the moment they were born. Perhaps it was just a twin thing? Or perhaps she was just scared Klaus would leave her one day. And the protective arms that made sure everything was okay would enclose around another. Did she have the strength to fend off for herself?</p><p>“Us against the world, huh?” She muttered.</p><p>“Sounds like you’re describing a certain different duo right now.” Hermione hummed. She noticed the confused look on Elly’s face immediately. “I mean you and Malfoy. Its been weeks and the two of you still bicker in your own quiet world in the back of Arithmancy. I told you at the start of term to stay away from him. He’s nothing but trouble, and you’ve witnessed it on many occasions, yet you still didn’t heed my warnings. What’s going on between you two?”</p><p>“Oh goodness, ‘Mione. I swear if I hadn’t known any better, I would have said you’re jealous. I mean hell, if you wanna swap seats that’s fine by me,” Elly said stretching her limbs. “Besides. All we do is banter. That’s really it. He annoys, I reply. I annoy, he replies.”</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips. Elly wasn’t one to directly approach people. And Elly now realizes this. She never initiates a conversation but now, looking at it, he’s literally snaked his way into her space. And she has complied with it thoughtlessly, initiating conversation after conversation with the most unlikeliest person in the school. Elly stared at the burning star in the ever-darkening sky. The darkness was like Malfoy. It snaked its way across the sky without anyone even knowing it, and by the time you realize its too late. Its already there.</p><p>“Now I know what you meant when you called him slimier than a toad,” She recalled Hermione’s words at the start of term before they both went to sleep. “He is slimy.”</p><p>“And you want to know the worse part?” She said. “Its only when you two are alone. He knows exactly when to trap you and when to strike. I thought he and Parkinson were a thing. Like an actual thing. But I’ve seen him bother you more than he’s bothered her in a few days. Crazy, right?”</p><p>“You know,” She huffed/laughed. “I could have lived without knowing that. Why are you analysing this so much anyway?”</p><p>“Because,” Hermione began. “Because I want you to know, of course. I don’t agree with you being on speaking terms with a guy like him. You know how cruel he can be. Maybe you haven’t experienced the extent of his cruelty, but I have. And so has Harry, and Ron, and just about every living person in Hogwarts who are not Slytherins. He seems to think differently of you. And I don’t think I agree with it.”</p><p>Elly’s eyes never left the sky. All throughout it all she kept her gaze on the transition of colours in the sky. The specs of mixing colours were interesting. As interesting as her thoughts right now. As interesting as the Sapphire gleam mixing with silvery stars that lit up the night sky. The thoughts travelling on her and Malfoy. An interesting mix of colours, silver and sapphire; an interesting mix of people. “Agree with what exactly? Do enlighten me.” Say it. <em>Say he’s interested in Ellyanna Aevum.</em></p><p>“He’s interested in you, Elly. And I don’t like it one bit.”</p>

  <p> </p><p>Halloween had finally arrived, and so did the trip to Hogsmeade that weekend. It was no doubt that every 3rd year had been awaiting this day; not because of the seasonal celebration, but for the latter. The 3rd years were finally able to visit Hogsmeade, the small wizarding town relatively nearby Hogwarts. A place that hosted wondrous sights and shops such as the infamous Shrieking shack, Madame Puttifoot’s tea shop, Zonko’s joke shop and of course, Honeydukes sweet shop. With butterbeer and candy sold alike in the small town, Elly was sold. She was excited to go. She was excited to go with her friends.</p><p>But that morning, Elly witnessed Harry being denied entry by Professor McGonagall. As the 3rd years began to rendezvous to the exit of the clocktower courtyard, Harry stayed stranded by the entrance. His grassy hues jealousy skimming the crowd before turning back towards Ron, Hermione and Elly.</p><p>“You didn’t get it signed Harry?” She asked as she moved away for 3rd years to depart towards Hogsmeade.</p><p>“Well, when you blow up your uncle’s sister…” He replied with a shrug. “Forget about it guys, see you later.” As Hermione and Ron began to depart, Elly pursed her lips and followed Harry, who, gave her a fleeting glare. “Elly-“</p><p>“I wanted all of to go together. I’m not gonna let you wander around Hogwarts by yourself,” She said as she linked arms with Harry. She tried to mask her disappointment when he slowly unlinked their arms and gave her a friendly push. “It won’t be fun without you.”</p><p>“Yes, it still will.”</p><p>“Believe me, it won’t.”</p><p><br/>
Although she promised she would stay with Harry during the next trip, she couldn’t deny that Hogsmeade was brilliant. It felt a lot like Diagon Alley without the hustle and bustle of adults. She parted ways with Ron and Hermione to explore with Klaus. The pressure of homework left behind along with the disappointment that she would not be seeing the sights with her friends in Gryffindor. Maybe next time, it could be all of them but for now, she would spend quality time with her brother.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Harry Potter was a superb Gryffindor, with the greatest of friends and the highest of expectations due to his past. He may not have been the perfect Gryffindor; however, he was the ideal Gryffindor. With a braveness many sought out to have and the dedication towards his friends and his beliefs. He was the idolized friend, the best big brother figure, the cutest little brother figure. He was everything, and he noticed everything. Like the little white lies Elly did. She always did a few here and there, to assure her brother and her friends that everything was fine. Justification was her reason. Cowardice was the truth. He wondered if she knew the wholesome reason behind her and her brother’s housing placement. Hermione had investigated it one day after the interesting Polyjuice potion plan the trio executed to find who the heir of Slytherin was. An eventful evening that was that led to them befriending the female Aevum the following day.</p><p>He wandered aimlessly outside of the castle, hands deep in his trouser pockets shivering like a leaf. His thoughts even deeper as he reminisced the days that led up to his unlikely friendship with the Aevum. At first, he wasn’t impressed with the former-beauxbaton student. He assumed she would be placed into Slytherin alongside her brother; the shock when the sorting hat called out Gryffindor. However, at that time she may as well have been placed into Slytherin in his eyes. She appeared delicate, especially when she was always with her brother. The two were inseparable, spending countless hours just wandering the halls or studying together in the library away from their own houses. She was, at first, soft spoken. Only speaking when spoken too. Well, she’s still like that now. He was impressed when they had been paired in charms. Her abilities exceeding his expectations as she tutored him, so they would have little to no homework that entire year. He was grateful for that as his year was certainly not the brightest, especially with the basilisk attacks that panicked the student body. But even that did not stop the two from separating. They were there for each other, a true family. At that point, he was jealous, jealous of the bond the siblings had despite the rivalry between the crimson and emerald houses.</p><p>And then that fateful day came when her delicate visage she held shattered and in its place was the birth of a lion cub. A lion cub that protected its kin. The sapphire hues that darkened as she pointed her wand to a certain Parkinson for barking at her brother’s ‘betrayal’. He had stood up for Hermione, and she followed suit loyally. She was nimble, from what he could remember, seeing her wave her hand so quickly and effortlessly to produce the leg locking charm. The way she roared at the Slytherin for her distasteful words towards both her housemate and her brother, it impressed Harry. He finally saw the inks of the bravery that embodied Gryffindors from Elly.</p><p>He stopped as he reached bridge that connected the courtyard to the hill atop the forbidden forest. The place where he first saw the delicate little lion roar. His cheeks a pink hue from the cold Autumn winds. Her stubbornness and persistence to get her words across to her opponent were admirable. She would put her health, her thoughts and her reputation on the line for her friends and her brother. Then he thought of it from a different perspective, what about her own?</p><p>Is that the reason for his findings in the Slytherin common room? He had kept a watchful on the Aevum twins after that moment, initiating small conversations with Elly, whom did not shun him over the rumours of him being the heir of Slytherin, and overall building a friendship with her. He was meticulous with his words when the twins were together, knowing how protective they can be when together. Like a great wall that conjured them against anyone who would be brave enough to step foot into their proximity. Only a few had succeeded: Himself, Hermione, the Weasley twins and Malfoy.</p><p>He thought the Slytherin was being sly at the time. He thought his actions were always concealed behind that arrogant expression. He thought nobody would see his eyes wander towards a certain Gryffindor but oh, was he wrong. And that fateful night, that night he had become Goyle confirmed everything.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>"Oi Aevum, Where are you going? Its nearly curfew. If you lose us house points for your dilly-dallying I’ll hex you," Draco called towards a fellow Slytherin exiting the common room. Ron and Harry glanced between Draco and Klaus Aevum inquisitively. They knew the two were on speaking terms though Klaus was rarely seen with anyone else besides his twin sister, whom ironically was a Gryffindor; The twins were inseparable even with their house rivalry. So, when both proud Slytherin figures would speak out in the halls or in their classroom, they almost appeared to be good friends. But right now, in this very room, it felt like two king cobras ready to strike each other at any moment.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Elly needs help with her assignments. I'll see you later," He replied as it if was the most obvious thing in the world. However, Harry noticed one thing between their short conversation. Klaus hadn't directed his farewell towards him and Ron. Only to Draco.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What a git. Spends most of his time with that Gryffindor than he does with us. Thinks he's better than us, does he? Spending time with her at a time like this? He's lucky he's a pureblood or he'd probably be the next target." Draco scoffed glaring where Klaus once stood. He fell onto one of the sofas with a smooth thud.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Well sit down," Draco gestured as he leaned into the leather sofa across from them. The two polyjuiced-Gryffindors obeyed as they cautiously adjusted to their surroundings. Unbeknownst to the Slytherin, he carried on his talk with them. "He's still a decent pureblood though, him and his sister. Unlike others around here. You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry nudged Ron as his face twisted into hate with clenched fists. He muttered something about a stomach-ache.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco stared at his two friends, scrutinizing their odd behaviour before letting go of his odd thoughts and continuing, "You know, I'm surprised the daily prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said that Dumbledore was the worst thing to ever happen to this place."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You're wrong!" Harry protested instantly. He was sure he screwed up. 'His' face must be full of shock from his own outburst as he stared at Draco's darkening face.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What? You think there’s someone worse than Dumbledore?" Draco scowled, his face only getting darker by the second. "Well? Do you?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"U-uh that Gryffindor..." Harry suggested on a whim. He was clueless of what to say. And seeing Klaus and Draco's conversation earlier had just fuelled him to use her as an open suggestion.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You're referring to Ellyanna Aevum, how dare you Goyle," Draco growled. Ron was panicking as he sat there unable to utter a single word. "To badmouth not only a fellow pureblood but a fellow housemate's sister? You know what I want to do with her you dimwit. You know how hard it is to hold my tongue when Parkinson goes off when she’s around, so she'd one day think differently of me. Yet you still act like the biggest idiot to have ever lived."</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"What? No, no I mean Harry Potter?" Harry panicked. His voice was wavering from both Draco's unexpected outburst and the fact that time was running out. They needed to focus on Draco spilling the beans on the heir of Slytherin before their polyjuice potion ran out. But this sudden aversion of conversation stuck to Harry like glue. He was planning something, and it had to do with Elly. Although he wanted to find it out, his priorities were to uncover the secrets of the heir first and then the mysterious case of Ellyanna Aevum.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="center"><br/>
<u> <em> (Note: he and Ron never find out. But they had a good hypothesis.)</em> </u></p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
<em> Draco eyes flashed in embarrassment, something Harry noticed, before they hardened again. "Oh. Maybe I’m thinking of her too much. Good one Goyle."</em></p><p dir="ltr"> </p>
<hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Maybe it was just a Slytherin trait; To be meticulous to the point they overthink things through. Klaus has done this many times with his overprotective personality. Always fearing for Elly to the point she may never fully stand up on her own. But he would always be there. Harry was always there for her from that day onwards, taking it upon himself to be the big brother figure when his brother was not around. Klaus would always be the one to help her stand and Harry would be there to help push her back on her feet so she could one day stand on her own two feet. He wasn’t jealous of the twin’s compassion anymore. Now that her loyalty as a friend, no, as a brother figure, was with him too now. And with Malfoy’s little stumble fresh on his mind everyday, that cemented his protectiveness over her day by day.</p><p>But, did he really want to be <em>just</em> a brother figure to Elly?</p><p>Harry briefly paused as he saw Professor Lupin crossing the bridge. His eyes roaming the landscape in content. He remembered the practical with the boggart that did not stare at him yet hovered towards him. With his thoughts on Elly ending, a new one began. The boggart taking the shape of a dementor. He approached Professor Lupin with newfound curiosity to have an unknowingly similar talk with the Professor that Elly once had with the respectful wizard.</p>
