# Data:
- 5 genres (romance, sci-fi, horror, erotica and detective), each approx of 100 texts. 
- Sources: site archiveofourown (fanfiction) and texts from Project Gutenberg
- Splitted to test and train set, so far approx 20/80
- **Possible additions and improvements**: data augmentation? mismatch learning?

# TODO:
- ndarray SVD
- KNN (Daniel's/ours implementation)
- if results of KNN aren't good: Logistic Regression
- if nothing of this works, Ann will dramatically try to implement a simple neural network
