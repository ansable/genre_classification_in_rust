    <p>Summary</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>When their ship is infested by a strange space-bug, Parker and Ssrk disagree on how to deal with it: research or destroy? Things get a bit hectic, though, when the creature decides to take the initiative...</p></blockquote>

    <p>Notes</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This was a nice little story I wrote for a sci fi contest over at Wattpad. The contest had a wordcount limit of 2000 words, but I liked it so much that I'm posting it here - maybe I'll add more chapters in the future. </p><p>It's not in any way related to my Apes series.</p><p>As always, I'd love if you'd leave me a comment if you liked the story, and tell me what you think of it. Would you read on? Do you think I should expand the story? Let me know.</p></blockquote>

      <p>„Whoa, will you look at that!"</p><p>Ssrk carefully ignored the human's outburst. It had proven to be the best strategy over the last six cycles to just let <em>Par-ker </em>vocalize his excitement while he was burrowing down into what he called 'research.'</p><p>Ssrk just wished they had thought of that strategy earlier, before the incident with the Arelian warship... or the incident with the intelligent trees on Agvor II... or the Delvian parasites that <em>Par-ker </em>had confused with some animal from his homeworld - he had only ever seen them on edu-vids, but he had sworn they were <em>butterflies... </em></p><p>Ssrk absently scratched their neck ridge. The memory still made their scales itch.</p><p>„No, really, will you come over and look at that thing! I think it's intelligent."</p><p>Ssrk didn't move from their station. „When did you become our intelligence specialist?"</p><p>After a moment of silence, Ssrk uttered a series of clicks to soften the blow. The human's emotions were as soft as his skin, and as easily hurt.</p><p>„I think it's eating through our hull," <em>Par-ker </em>murmured. He sounded thoughtful.</p><p>With a trill, Ssrk was at his side. „You only thought <em>now</em> of relaying that piece of <em>highly relevant information</em> to me?" they hissed.</p><p>„I just now realized what it was doing," <em>Par-ker</em> defended himself. „At first I thought it was just some weird-ass space debris, until it started walking up the hull to wave at the camera. Hey, maybe it wanted to take a selfie!"</p><p>Ssrk stared at the screen that showed a dark, multi-legged shape sitting at the edge of the camera's field of vision, doing ostensibly nothing. It had positioned itself almost exactly in the camera's dead angle. Ssrk toggled the controls, but couldn't get a better view.</p><p>„I already tried that," <em>Par-ker </em>muttered. „That thing knows where to squat." He frowned at the screen, apparently more annoyed at the thing's refusal to pose for the camera than worried about the damage it was inflicting on the ship's hull. Speaking of which...</p><p>„How did you determine it was corroding our hull?" Ssrk wanted to know.</p><p><em>Par-ker </em>just pointed to another screen to his left without taking his eyes from the creature. „Looks like a damn spider," he murmured. „A space spider. How does it not need to breathe?"</p><p>„Please refrain from comparing unknown life-forms to your homeworld's fauna," Ssrk murmured absently while they studied the readings. <em>Par-ker </em>had been right, unfortunately - a patch of ten <em>prent</em> in diameter was showing signs of rapid deterioration. At that speed, the thing would've created an opening in less than a half <em>itar. </em></p><p>„We should go out and take a closer look at Spidey," <em>Par-ker </em>suggested, some of his former excitement creeping back into his voice. „Maybe put it into a cage, take some samples..."</p><p>„We will <em>not, </em>I repeat, <em>not </em>take whatever this is into the ship," Ssrk said sternly. „Really, <em>Par-ker, </em>sometimes I wonder how your species survived long enough to develop spaceflight." <em>And afflict the rest of us with your presence</em>. „In case you hadn't noticed, this creature is damaging the integrity of our ship. It may be able to withstand radiation - not to mention the lack of heat and oxygen - but I doubt that either you or I will be able to emulate it in that regard." They tipped a talon at the screen. „Besides, if it's able to dissolve our hull, what kind of box do you think will be suited to contain it?"</p><p><em>Par-ker</em> scratched the patch of fur on his head, a sign of confusion, frustration, or the hatching of another insane plan. „I was thinking of that wooden crate of yours..."</p><p>„No." Ssrk didn't bother to explain why the 'wooden crate' wasn't up for debate. <em>Par-ker's </em>insatiable curiosity was exhausting enough as it was now - they wouldn't feed it with information about Itsiran religious observations.</p><p>„No, hear me out!" <em>Par-ker </em>gestikulated wildly, and Ssrk forcefully pushed a fantasy of him tied to the <em>Atista's </em>hull from their mind. „This thing can eat through metal, alright," the human continued, blissfully unaware of Ssrk's musings. „Inorganic material. But wood is totally different from metal, and if it evolved to deal with metal, I bet that wood wasn't even on its radar!"</p><p>It... made sense, in the insane way Ssrk had come to associate with humans.</p><p>„No," they repeated. „We will <em>not</em> try to contain it. We <em>will </em>remove it from our hull, take as many readings as we can <em>from a distance, </em>and send the data back to Itsir for further evaluation. <em>Then," </em>they continued, ignoring <em>Par-ker's </em>stuttered protests, „you will have the pleasure to weld a new scaling to the hull. You may take samples from the corrupted site as your heart desires, for science's sake."</p><p><em>Par-ker</em> stared at them. His mouth stood slightly open, but no sounds came out. It was a nice sight.</p><p>„You're doing that just to shit on me," <em>Par-ker</em> said finally.</p><p>„I assure you that nothing could be farther from my mind," Ssrk replied dryly. „I suggest you suit up - at that rate, your <em>spidr </em>will be sitting in your lap in less than twenty of your <em>minutes</em>. I doubt you'd enjoy that."</p><p>*</p><p>Vibrations.</p><p>Different pattern of vibrations, not the continuous hum, the low cadences, the promise of... something.</p><p>The new pattern was much slower; a distinct burst of tremors, then silence, then another burst. The tremors were getting more intense with each new burst.</p><p>The infant mind scrambled to make sense of the pattern. Cause still unknown, but coming closer.</p><p>Dangerous?</p><p>Alarm.</p><p>Flight was not an option. Hunger was overwhelming.</p><p>
  <em>Eat faster.</em>
</p><p>*</p><p>„Do you remember when I changed the settings on your magnetic boots? That was fun."</p><p>The silence from his earpiece was deafening.</p><p>It dawned on Parker that maybe he shouldn't piss off the ship's commander while he was crawling over the ship's hull like a fly on a viewscreen - a second after the words had left his mouth, as usual.</p><p>Hey, the lizard should be used to his brand of humor by now. If they had wanted to, they could've shoved him out of an airlock a long time ago. Or eaten him in his sleep.</p><p>
  <em>Lizzy likes me, the ol' softie. They're just too proud to admit it.</em>
</p><p>Spacewalks hadn't been on Parker's list of things he was eager to do once he escaped life as a hydroponics tech. Space<em> battles</em> was more what he had been thinking of, or at least discovering new life forms, new civilizations...</p><p>And now that he <em>had </em>discovered a new life form, he had been ordered to blast it to smithereens.</p><p><em>So I got a new scientific discovery </em>and <em>a space battle in one package. Nice trick, universe. That's not how I worded that order.</em></p><p>The thing really looked like a spider. Or a trilobite? It had a shell, at least, and too many protrusions extending from an opening in that shell that were all clamping at the metal of the hull that it was currently dissolving, if one could believe the sensors. As much as it pained Parker to admit, the sensors were most probably right, and the thing <em>was </em>trying to get to their machine room, to...</p><p>... yeah, to do what, exactly? Drink the coolant?</p><p>„Stop dawdling, <em>Par-ker, </em>eliminate that creature!"</p><p>Parker flinched when Ssrk's sharp voice suddenly pierced his ear. The Itsiran voice had some frequencies that weren't exactly audible, but still painful when they hit a human eardrum.</p><p>„You said I could take readings, Ssrk, and that's what I'm gonna do! We had a deal, lizard-man!"</p><p>„Stop calling me that."</p><p>Parker slowly crouched down and raised his scanner. It could just have been his imagination, but the protrusions... legs... tentacles... what<em>ever, </em>okay?... were moving more rapidly now, scratching over the metal plates as if the thing was trying to dig its way through. It was a bit hair-raising, but a scientist should be above primitive reactions like loathing.</p><p>„Hey, you won't believe this, Ssrk."</p><p>„I've stopped that habit since I've met you."</p><p>„That thing isn't organic. It's made of metal."</p><p>"..."</p><p>„Hey, are you still there?"</p><p>„That's impossible," Ssrk's voice was flat.</p><p>„I thought you broke with that habit. I'm sending you the readings, judge for yourself."</p><p>There was another pause, while Ssrk was hopefully studying the readings, and not suiting up themselves and packing a bigger blaster.</p><p>„Set your blaster to maximum, and fire," Ssrk snarled. „Don't hesitate, do it <em>now!"</em></p><p><em>That's not the scientific mindset, Ssrk! How could your people develop spaceflight if they are so </em>uninterested<em> in the unknown? </em>But it was no use arguing with the Itsiran when they were in that mood. And while <em>he</em> was on the wrong side of the door.</p><p>Parker reluctantly pushed the slider to the maximum position, took aim, and fired.</p><p>The creature glowed bright red, let out a whine that definitely sounded mechanical, and plunged through the hull. Parker stared at the hole that had been hidden under the thing's carapace.</p><p>„Well, shit."</p><p>*</p><p>„What do you mean, you lost it? It's a big-ass, metallic space spider, it should be kinda <em>striking?"</em></p><p>Parker peered behind a metallic ladder that led from one level of the machine room to the next, while Ssrk was busy searching that upper level. They were reasonably sure that the machine room had been the creature's intended destination, and it wasn't that big - the whole ship wasn't that big to begin with - but somehow, the damn spider had successfully performed a vanishing act.</p><p>„It's a metallic thing in a room full of metallic things," Ssrk snapped. „The sensors are telling me there is something metallic <em>all around me."</em></p><p>„Okay, okay. Let's think logically for a minute here." Parker leaned against the ladder and tried to catch his breath.</p><p><em>„Now  </em>you want to acquire a new skill?" Ssrk said acridly.</p><p>Parker ignored the jab. „My dad always used to say... a good hunter doesn't chase after his prey, he lets the prey come to him."</p><p>„And what was your father chasing after, on a space station?" Something heavy fell down with a clunk, followed by rapid-fire clicks and trills.</p><p>„Women, mostly," Parker admitted. „But that's beside the point. We need a bait. And your crate."</p><p>*</p><p>„Dude, this is like the buffet at the Christmas party the station commander threw every year," <em>Par-ker</em> muttered.</p><p>„I doubt they offered metal scraps, <em>tharian</em> crystals, and coolant fluid there," Ssrk muttered back.</p><p>„Well, they <em>said </em>it was vodka," <em>Par-ker </em>mused.</p><p>They had arranged a sampling of everything potentially alluring to the creature on the lid of Ssrk's meditation cube. The rest of the cube hung above it, suspended from the railing of the upper deck of the machine room. <em>Par-ker</em>  was holding the rope that kept the crate hovering over the lid, a fact that Ssrk found slightly worrying. But it had been the human's idea, so he'd have the honor of trapping the creature.</p><p><em>If </em>it turned up. Ssrk didn't want to contemplate what kind of havoc it was currently wreaking somewhere on their ship.</p><p>„Here she comes," <em>Par-ker  </em>whispered suddenly.</p><p>A shadow was moving in a corner that Ssrk had already searched twice. In the next moment, the creature sat on the lid, testing <em>Par-ker's </em>selection of treats.</p><p><em>Par-ker</em>  let go of the rope, and the crate crashed down and closed over the lid. A protesting whine erupted from within, and for a moment, bright light pierced through the edges...</p><p>... and died down. Faint, scrabbling noises indicated the creature was still inside the wooden crate, and still alive - insofar something inorganic could be called that.</p><p><em>Par-ker</em>  turned to Ssrk. „If I beat you at your lizard-chess, can I keep it for research?"</p><p>Ssrk scoffed. „As if."</p><p>„Fine." <em>Par-ker </em>scrambled to his feet. „Gimme a minute to rig the board."</p><p>Ssrk eyed the cube. They should kick it out an airlock while the human was busy manipulating the parameters of the game. Not that it would help him win... only to save face.</p><p>Humans were weird.</p>
