    <p>Notes</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>If you're reading this, hello and welcome to one of the first things I've written in 10 years because smut is for sure the first place someone so rusty should start. *facepalm* I'm not super crazy over this title or the description but my brain shut down completely trying to do that so here we are. I've posted this a few other places so someone might have seen it already, however I took them all down because self doubt is super fun and I've always been the most critical of my own work, especially after not writing at all for so long. But, thought I'd try again anyway. I think I caught every typo, but I probably missed some. I can only stand to read my own writing so many times lol. If you see one, please let me know! ^.^ Hopefully someone out there enjoys this!</p></blockquote>

  <em>My office. 22:00. Be ready. -G</em><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse reads the note left on his bed before crushing it in his hand, shutting his eyes tightly and clenching his jaw. The handwriting was Gabriel's. He can feel waves of heat rushing towards his groin as his heart aches, the conflicting feelings inside him putting his stomach in knots.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He hates this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He should have known he'd find a note today, having heard the yelling between Gabriel and Jack earlier in the day as he walked past Jack's office. He couldn't quite make out all of what they'd been arguing about but he distinctly remembers hearing Jack tell Gabriel that the decision was final before he heard the sound of what he assumed was Gabriel's fist punching a hole through the wall. Gabriel always came to him after he and Jack would fight, using Jesse to get his frustrations out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The first time it happened had been unplanned. Jesse had been up late filling out a mission report he was supposed to write up days ago when his Commander had come stalking through the halls, fuming from an argument he'd just had with Jack. Jesse's door had been open. Gabriel had came in his room, shutting the door behind him. Jesse hadn't heard him enter until he'd heard the sound of his door shutting. He turned around then, seeing Gabriel glaring at him, his chest rising and falling quickly with his rapid breathing. They stared at each other for what felt like an eternity, the sexual tension hanging between them so thick Jesse felt like it was about to suffocate him. Before Jesse knew it he was bent over his desk, Gabriel's hands gripping his waist so tightly he left bruises there, as his Commander fucked him so hard his vision had went blurry from the intense pleasure of it all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse liked their arrangement for awhile. He'd given him a key to his room, and Gabriel had given him a key to his office. Gabriel would come to him late at night, or send for Jesse to come to him, and they would roll around together. Gabriel was always so rough with him, but Jesse liked it that way. He didn't even mind that once Gabriel had finished with him, he would get cleaned up and leave, or tell Jesse to get out. It was the rare occasion though, when Gabriel would hold him afterwards and talk to him that Jesse found things getting complicated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He was falling in love with his Commander.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He remembers a night months ago when Gabriel had confirmed what he'd suspected for some time. Gabriel and Jack were together, and had been for years. Others had suspected the same thing, but no one dared to ask. It hadn't been any of their business what their Commanding Officers did with their personal lives as the two of them chose to keep their relationship out of work. Jesse asked once if Jack knew about their arrangement and his Commander had waved him off, ignoring the question completely and stopping any further questions by putting his dick in Jesse's mouth. He's pretty sure Jack doesn't know and he hates himself for that, especially when he continually finds himself underneath Gabriel.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He knows tonight won't be any different. He wants to go just as much as he doesn't, maybe even more. He always hopes for those times that Gabriel lets him stay for awhile, when he's sweet to him and laughs at the things Jesse says as they cuddle. He'd give anything to have those nights every night.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse uncrumples the note, reading it again. He glances at the alarm clock by his bed, he had twenty minutes. <em>Be ready.</em> He knew what that meant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He turns towards his bedside table, opening the drawer and staring at the bottle of lube inside it. His body wants this. He can feel the tingles spreading through him at just the thought of Gabriel inside him. Part of his heart wants it too, wants to just be near him, to smell his cologne and feel the warmth of his body pressing against him. The other part is screaming at Jesse to stay here, don't go.<em> Don't let Gabriel use you anymore. Don't get anymore caught up in these feelings. Let him go. Yell at him for being such a prick. Ask him how Jack would feel if he knew his boyfriend was fucking someone else before he came to see him.</em> Jesse stops himself at that one. He's just as guilty as Gabriel is. He picks up the bottle and closes the drawer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Tossing it onto his bed, he begins to unbuckle his pants, tugging them down slightly before letting them fall to the floor. He does the same with his underwear before stepping out of them. Reaching for the lube, he pops the cap and squirts a copious amount onto 3 of his fingers before crawling on to his bed, carefully holding his lubed fingers away from his mattress. He briefly wonders what their argument had been about. Usually Gabriel enjoyed doing this part and only requested Jesse do it if the fight had been bad and he wasn't in the mood for it, wanting to be able to get straight to business. He leans his right shoulder down into the mattress, awkwardly propping himself up. He reaches the lubed fingers back around him, gently rubbing at his hole to coat his entrance with some the extra lube he'd squirted onto them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He closes his eyes, sighing at the slight discomfort of his finger entering him. He slowly traces a circle inside himself, moving his finger in and out as he goes. When he feels comfortable he adds a second finger, tracing the same circle as he continues to move his fingers in and out, making sure to scissor his fingers apart between each circle he traces. He imagines Gabriel behind him then, the thought sending that wave of heat to his groin once more. He pushes his fingers in deeper, feeling for where he knows his prostate is. He presses against it gently, moaning softly into the bed below him. He rubs his fingers against it a few more times, feeling himself beginning to harden from the stimulation. Another finger. It's uncomfortable, but he knows he'll thank himself for it later when Gabriel is there in place of his fingers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse continues the motion of tracing circles, some bigger than others, pressing against his prostate every other circle he makes. He's hard now, wanting desperately to touch himself but he prefers to come when he's with Gabriel, so he stops himself, grabbing a fist full of his bed sheets and gripping them tightly to give his free arm something to do. He slows his circles now, avoiding nudging against his prostate anymore. He tilts his head upwards to glance at his clock. Ten minutes. Knowing Gabriel's office is at least a five minute walk, seeing as how it was halfway across the base from where Jesse was at, he stops; pulling his fingers free and pushing off the bed where he redresses, silently hoping he'd done enough to accommodate his Commander's size. He grabs the key to Gabriel's office and heads out his door.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>On his walk over, he remembers why he prefers when Gabriel comes to him. The fabric of his jeans rubbing against his hard member is almost too much to bear. He wonders for a moment if Gabriel will be hard already, or if he'll be putting Jesse's mouth to work. Usually the former on nights like this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He pauses when he reaches Gabriel's office, taking a deep breath. He can see the faint glow of a lamp under the doors threshold. Jesse takes a quick glance around him before putting the key in the lock and turning it slowly. He shuts the door quietly behind him, glancing towards Gabriel's desk chair. His back is to him, but Jesse can just barely see his arm moving up and down in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"I said 10, not 9:55."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Sir, it's five minutes."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Oh, is it? Thank you, McCree. I had no fuckin' idea how time worked. Get undressed."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse does as he's told, kicking his clothes towards the couch across the room. He strokes himself a few times now, sighing in relief at the feeling of his hand on his cock. He notices the empty spot on Gabriel's desk that he'd cleared off. It'd been one of their favorite spots since that first night in Jesse's room.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Gabriel turns around in his chair after a few minutes, already naked and very hard, beads of pre-come glistening around the head of his thick cock. "You know where it is."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse walks around behind Gabriel's desk, opening the last drawer and pulling out the lube Gabriel kept in their. The thought of the same lube being used on Jack briefly flashes through his mind. He walks back around to the front as Gabriel stands up now and follows him, still stroking himself. Jesse pops the cap and hands it to him, leaning down and propping himself up on his elbows. He glances over his shoulder, watching Gabriel squeeze a quarter sized amount into the palm of his hand before he spreads it over the length of his dick before he takes his thumbs and places one on either side of Jesse's ass cheeks, spreading him open. Gabriel smiles.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Good boy." The sound of a smack echoes through Gabriel's office before Jesse feels the sting of it. He gasps, rocking his hips back towards Gabriel who smacks at his ass again. "You like that?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Yes." Jesse whimpers, wiggling his ass in front of Gabriel, feeling his hard cock pressing against him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"I'm sorry, yes what?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Yes, sir."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He feels Gabriel tug at his cheeks again, the tip of his cock brushing against his stretched entrance. "You must want it bad tonight. You never behave this well, do you? You little fuckin' slut."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Gabriel begins to push his length inside Jesse, who moans at the feeling of his walls stretching around his Commander. There's a slight discomfort but he's thankful for his attentiveness earlier in the night to prepare himself for Gabriel's thickness. He feels a hand at the nape of his neck, pushing his head down onto the desk, another hand resting above his ass. Gabriel gives a few slow rocks of his hips, giving Jesse a moment to adjust before he pulls back and slams himself back into him. Jesse grunts in response, his nails desperately trying to dig into the wood of Gabriel's desk, looking for something, anything, to grab as Gabriel began to pound his length into him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse melts into a whimpering mess below Gabriel, eyes fluttering shut as the head of Gabriel's cock prods at his prostate with each thrust into him. Jesse's cock is rapidly leaking pre-come, and he reaches a hand down to grab at his cock; stroking himself in time with Gabriel's thrusts. He feels the hand at the nape of his neck snake upwards into his hair, where Gabriel grabs a fistful and yanks his head up off the desk. Jesse yelps and Gabriel grunts in return, digging his nails into Jesse's waist.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"I'm gonna come inside you, you want that?" Gabriel growls the words at him, punctuating his <em>that</em> with a sharp thrust that hits his prostate directly. Jesse moans loudly at the feeling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Yes, sir." Jesse pants the words out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Of course you do. You love when I come inside you, don't you?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse tries to respond, but each attempt is cut off by a hit to his prostate where all he can do is moan. The pace on his own cock quickens, feeling his orgasm quickly building. Gabriel tugs at his hair again, using his free hand to smack at Jesse's ass, admiring the sight of the red mark in the shape of his hand there. "Don't you?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>With one final stroke down his length, Jesse is coming, spilling himself into his hand and onto Gabriel's office floor. He's panting, lost in a world of bliss, when the sharp tug of the hand in his hair snaps him back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"I asked you a question." Gabriel is still thrusting into him hardly, but there's a stutter in his pattern now. Jesse recognizes this as the sign Gabriel is about to come.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Yes, sir." He lets out a shaky breath as Gabriel releases the grip on his hair, placing  a hand on either side of his waist and gripping him tightly, nails digging into his skin there. He pulls Jesse back to meet his thrusts now, pushing himself deeper inside him. Jesse lets his head fall back onto the table as Gabriel gives a final hard, deep thrust into him before he feels a wet warmth inside him. He clenches around Gabriel then, earning a grunt from the man behind him as he squirts his final spurts of come inside Jesse. Gabriel stays there for a moment, grunting and panting and swearing at Jesse for being "such a slut". When he finally pulls out, he slaps at Jesse's ass one more time before walking back around behind his desk and grabbing one of the small towels he kept in the drawer with his lube. He cleans himself off, sitting back down in his chair.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse is still bent over Gabriel's desk, letting his breathing slow down to his normal pace. He glances up at Gabriel, who has his head tilted back against his headrest and eyes shut. Jesse slowly pushes himself up right after some time, standing awkwardly by Gabriel's desk, fiddling with his hands as he asks, "Can I stay awhile?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Gabriel opens one eye and stares at him, studying Jesse's hopeful expression. For a minute Jesse thinks Gabriel is going to grab him and pull him onto his lap. He feels his heart leap in his chest at the thought of Gabriel's arms wrapped around him. Instead, he tosses the towel at Jesse and closes his eye again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Get out."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse shuts his eyes now, balling his hand into a fist around the towel and squeezing it tightly. He feels his stomach drop, a sick feeling swirling around inside him. He cleans himself off, grabbing for his clothes and dressing quickly, biting at the inside of his lip so hard he can taste blood in his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"This is the last time." He knows he's lying when he says that, and by the way Gabriel laughs at him as he shuts the door on his way out, he knows it too.</p>

        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>If you've made it this far, thanks so much for reading! I feel like I should apologize for the lack of dialogue because there's few things I love more in this ship than a sassy mouthed Jesse but there somehow ended up being more feelings than words. It's shaky. I tried. I guess it could be worse after not writing anything for 10 years. Not gonna lie, kinda want to delete it already lol. Oh well. Once again, THANK YOU for reading!</p><p>*edit to add that there's actually a second part to this but I like really, REALLY hated it soooo I dunno about posting it. *shrug*</p></blockquote>
