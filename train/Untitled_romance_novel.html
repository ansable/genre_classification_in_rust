  <h1>Untitled - romance novel</h1>
  <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/allysonwonderlnd/pseuds/allysonwonderlnd">allysonwonderlnd</a></div>
    <p>Summary</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This is just the first chapter of something I have been working on. I'm looking for advice and constructive criticism. I'm also looking for encouragement because I'm 32 and it's taken me this long to actually sit down and try to write a romance novel. I would like to make this my future and have always dreamed about being a writer. I'm currently getting no support from my family because, "who will buy it?" and "You've had all this time to write a book". So, if you see the potential for something somewhat okay here, please tell me. Again, this is just a first chapter so there isn't much here, but I do want to know if as a reader if you would keep reading based off of this crappy, not even completely finished first chapter. Thank you in advance!</p></blockquote>

      <p>Madeline sat at her desk, her fingers hesitating over the keyboard of her laptop. She thought this move was what she needed to finally start her novel, but she seemed to be more blocked than ever. The view alone should have been enough to inspire something inside of her, but the lack of creativity was only starting to spark a slight resentment. Her small stone cottage stood on top of a small hill overlooking twin mountains reflecting off of a large lake, the end to a wide river running between the sisters. Another similar cottage sat at the base of the hill with a small dock reaching out into the water. Madeline had only saw a boat once, bobbing with the waves, when she first moved in. An hour into unloading the remaining boxes from her car, the boat had vanished. For two weeks the dock remained empty and it seemed that her computer screen was following suit. Huffing, she closed her laptop and went into the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. </p><p>    The cottage was small, but cozy. The outside was a layered stone of varied versions of gray. Against the east wall of the living area, stood a fireplace made of the same stone. The slate gray loveseat she ordered online arrived a few days ago and was a nice addition to the white upholstered chair she already owned. She put her desk in front of the picture window on the wall perpendicular to the fireplace. There was a matching picture window on the wall parallel to the one her desk looked out on, but the view was of her driveway and the forest that engulfed it. The kitchen bled into the living room, the same laminate wood flooring was used for both, and her bedroom. It had been in the back of her mind to replace it since she first closed on the cottage. </p><p>Madeline had only gotten as far as unpacking the essentials inside of the house. There was a stone patio outside of her bedroom window that she was far more interested in decorating. The previous owners had left couple of chairs and a table, worn from age and weather. She thought about how well they cleaned up from the hours scrubbing as she took a seat on one. Slightly sighing, she looked out over the yard. A worn path led from the sitting area to a garden, bordered in buttery yellow stones. The garden itself was unruly, but it had a lot of potential. She spent the past fews days cleaning out the weeds and dead plants. There was still a grouping of pink and yellow flowers overflowing one side of the garden and continuing into the grass, becoming more spotted the farther it grew. A few bushes had done the same, but they appeared to be satisfied with just covering the stones. She still had quite a bit of work to do, but at least this was better than staring at the blinking cursor on the computer screen. Taking a black hairband off of her wrist, she pushed back her shoulder length, dusty blond waves and secured it into a ponytail. After one last drink of her coffee, she set it on the table and picked up a pair of gardening gloves.</p><p>---</p><p> </p><p>The sun was beginning to set when Madeline finally felt that she had done enough work for the day. The pink and yellow flowers were still an outstretched hand grabbing at the grass, but the bushes had been trimmed back to an acceptable size and only signs of life remained. She was happy to find a few plant attempting to grow under the mess of decaying plants she removed.  With everything cleaned out, she had a decent space to plant some vegetables in the future. Being at the end of the summer season, she wasn’t quite sure what, and when, she should plant and made a mental note to look it up online. She brushed some stray hairs off of her forehead and looked out at the lake. It was growing darker by the minute, but she could tell that something was moving on the water. Once it moved a bit closer, she could make out the silhouette of a sail. She stood there for a few minutes, wondering who they were and where they had been, before finally deciding on going back in. She needed to wash off all of the dirt and sweat. Another cup a coffee sounded good as well. </p><p>    Fully relaxed after her shower, Madeline set her coffee cup on the desk with her left hand and continued towel drying her hair with her right. She looked out the picture window and saw a dim light shining in one of the windows of the cottage at the bottom of the hill. Three bright flames danced in a line outside, bringing her eyes to the shadowy figure moving on the docks. After a few minutes, the figure stopped whatever it was working on and started walking toward the cottage, extinguishing each dancing flame as they went past. She turned off her own lights, she looked back one more time. This time, the owner of the other cottage was looking out their window, up at hers. She flushed, slightly embarrassed that they had caught her watching, but grateful the darkness was hiding her now. She moved further back, letting the darkness of the house close in on her before taking four big steps to quickly hide in her room.</p>
