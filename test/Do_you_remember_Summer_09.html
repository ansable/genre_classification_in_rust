  <h1>Do you remember Summer '09?</h1>
  <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/larrycaring/pseuds/larrycaring">larrycaring</a></div>
    <p>Summary</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Louis Tomlinson is expecting a normal summer, but it all changes when his father – fearing that his family is growing apart and the children are growing up too fast – persuades everyone to go on a family vacation one last time, at the lake where they used to go.</p><p>After ten years, Louis Tomlinson meets Harry Styles again. He never expected that the little boy with chubby cheeks turned into such an amazing person, with whom Louis develops a growing friendship over the summer.</p><p>Louis has always wanted to find the right person, who makes him breathless every single time — even after a long time relationship — a person who makes him happy every single day, a person who is everything to him, a person he truly feels connected with. </p><p>Maybe the lake is a good place to fall in love with someone…</p><p>And maybe Harry is that someone?</p></blockquote>

    <p>Notes</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Okay, bear with me ‘cause this may be long…</p><p>I’ve been working on this fic for two years now, and it’s finally here. And yes, this fic is totally an excuse for me to write Louis and Harry falling in love during summer, as I said in the tags.</p><p>Just to be clear, the places where Louis and Harry’s families stay at are real houses. In the Cheaper by the Dozen movie, the Baker family stays a rental house, but in this fic I decided for both family to be owner of the lake houses (they’re rich af, I know).</p><p>I also wanna add that I looked up a lot of things to make the story as real as possible, but since this fic is set in 2009 and the websites I used are all updated to 2016, of course, some things weren't necessarily there in 2009, or named that way. But yeah, I tried to make the fic as accurate as possible, but it cannot be chronologically perfect. But it's a fic so, yeah… Let’s roll with that.</p><p>Since Louis and Harry's families are big, especially Louis', you may get confused and lost with all the names and ages, so I made a list:</p><p>The Tomlinsons:</p><p>Dad: Tristen Tomlinson 1966<br/>Mom: Natasha Tomlinson 1969</p><p>Oldest to eldest (11 kids):</p><p>July 13, 1987 - Warren Tomlinson (Boy) - 22 years old in 2009</p><p>June 20, 1989 - Mary Tomlinson (Girl) - 18 years old in 2009</p><p>December 22, 1992 - Louis Tomlinson (Boy) - 17 years old in 2009</p><p>March 22, 1994 - Elisa Tomlinson (Girl) - 15 years old in 2009</p><p>January 24, 1995 - Ella Tomlinson (Girl) - 14 years old in 2009</p><p>May 28, 1996 - Daniel Tomlinon (Boy) - 13 years old in 2009</p><p>September 11, 1997 - Jeanne Tomlinson (Girl) - 12 years old in 2009</p><p>March 23, 1998 - Elizabeth Tomlinson (Girl) - 11 years old in 2009</p><p>March 23, 1998 - Nathan Tomlinson (Boy) - 11 years old in 2009</p><p>August 18, 1999 - Ren Tomlinon (Boy) - 10 years old in 2009</p><p>March 29, 2005 - Erin Tomlinson (Girl) - 4 years old in 2009</p><p>The Styles':<br/>Dad: Trent Styles (1965)</p><p>Mom: Alice Styles (1969)</p><p>Oldest to eldest (6 kids):</p><p>April 22, 1987 - William Styles (Boy) - 22 years old in 2009</p><p>April 22, 1987 - Erica Styles (Girl) - 22 years old in 2009</p><p>February 12, 1993 - Harry Styles (Boy) - 16 years old in 2009</p><p>May 24, 1997 - Vicky Styles (Girl) - 12 years old in 2009</p><p>August 3, 1998 - Matthew Styles (Boy) - 11 years old in 2009</p><p>March 17, 2000 - Tara Styles (Girl) - 9 years old in 2009</p><p> </p><p>  <strong>Keep it close in case you need it. ;)</strong></p><p> </p><p>Speaking of families, although this fic is inspired by Cheaper by the Dozen 2, I didn't really do the family rivalry, at least not as emphasized as it is in the movie. What I mean is that Louis' and Harry's dads aren't <em>that</em> competitive during the whole fic like in the movie; claiming which child is the best, because all of their children are the best to them!!!!!</p><p><strong>I will be updated this fic frequently, but since it’s very long and my friend and beta</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/rogueskimo" rel="nofollow">Liz</a> <strong>cannot edit all at once, I’ll post this fic chapter by chapter! But I did write the whole fic. It just needs to be edited.</strong></p><p>Okay, last but not least: ENJOY! :):):)</p><p>I really hope you like it guys. <strong>Please, do leave a comment and tell me what you think!</strong></p></blockquote>

</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis was in the middle of a FIFA game with his eleven-year-old brother, Nathan, when his little sisters Jeanne and Elizabeth burst through the door, uproarious laughers filling the room.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“First,” Jeanne shouts mirthfully. Her long black wavy hair, which had been tied up in a ponytail, is a complete mess now, but she doesn’t seem to mind as she raises a hand in victory. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Behind her, Elizabeth huffs, her freckled face expressing nothing but exhaustion at her sister’s enthusiasm. She folds her arms against her chest. “That is not fair! You cheated on the stairs, J,” she retorts, scowling. Her long, light brown hair is tied up in a braid, tugging on it with a frown. Then she raises her chin in challenge and confrontation at her sister, but Jeanne only raises an unimpressed eyebrow at her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Shhh, be quiet, Beth,” Nathan hisses at his twin sister, biting his bottom lip in concentration while his player on the TV screen is deprived of his soccer ball by one of Louis’ players.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Of course, Louis cheers with a big smile when he promptly scores a few seconds later. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ugh,” groans Nathan besides him, letting himself fall on his back on Louis’ bed as Louis grins at the screen, where the score reads 4-1 for him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It's okay, buddy,” Louis teases, patting his brother’s leg. “You'll do better next time.” Nathan only groans in response, making Louis chuckle more.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Nathan hastily sits upright then, pointing an accusatory finger at the girls. “It's your fault, you two! You made me lose my concentration when you barged in!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Both girls roll their eyes at that, clearly in disagreement. “You’re just a sore loser, that’s all,” counters Jeanne in a cheeky way, flipping her hair behind her shoulder.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis can't resist the urge to snicker loudly, earning a glare from Nathan, who can’t find anything to respond with. Louis shakes his head, a smile still plastered on his face. He eyes his sisters. “I agree with him, though,” he concedes. “What did I tell you girls about my room?” He raises an expecting eyebrow.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"To knock before coming in," they answer in unison, Jeanne letting out a sigh as if the words were hard to admit. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Right," Louis affirms with a satisfied grin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Sorry, Loulou,” says Elizabeth with a delicate voice, batting her eyelashes. She goes sit on his lap, and he naturally wraps an arm around her tiny waist. "Next time I won't forget, promise!" She pecks his cheek in apology, and with her sweet expression … well, Louis doesn't really stand a chance. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He rolls his eyes fondly, shaking his head. "You're already forgiven, sweetheart.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Anyway," Jeanne begins, her foot tapping on the floor. "Dad and Mum are calling for a family reunion downstairs.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Nathan runs a hand through his short brown hair, letting out a sigh with a blasé face. "Don't tell me they already want us to go to bed? It's only 9:30! Summer’s just started.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis finds it funny how he is saying that. As if they <em>actually </em>have an early curfew. Well, maybe the kids have a curfew, but Louis is seventeen, and therefore he can stay up late. But still, once he was young, so he knows how his brother feels. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Jeanne frowns at her twin, looking at him with a bored expression. "No, silly. They said it was something about this summer,” she says, sounding uncertain. “I don't know.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis delicately taps Beth’s waist, motioning for her to get up so that he can stand. "Well kids, let's go then.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They don't need to be told twice. Nathan and the girls make a run for it, Jeanne yelling ‘last one to get there is a rotten egg’, making Louis chuckle. These kids are too competitive for their own good. Seriously. Nathan is champion swimmer at school because he simply cannot accept that someone could be faster than him in the water. ‘It is just out of question!’ or aka Nathan’s motivation to always be on top.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shakes his head, searching for his phone on his bed. He finds it on his desk, and Louis unconsciously looks up, staring at his painted wall. It has been freshly painted, the design imagined and drawn by Zayn. Louis has some talented friends.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As he makes his way downstairs to the living room, he checks his messages, seeing one from his best friend Stan, informing Louis about the next gig they need to go to. Another one is from his ex, Hannah, wishing him good night. He smiles sweetly, albeit hesitantly. They broke up and remained on good terms, but sometimes he feels like she is still waiting for him to come back. Which is not happening, because … Well, she would know. He told her. He isn’t interested in girls anymore. He answers her quickly, before texting Stan: <b>Of course dude, I'm in! Let's buy some tickets!</b></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Everyone's here?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At his mother's impatient but gentle tone, Louis looks up from his phone, taking into sight all his siblings huddled together on the couches. He smiles at his ten-year-old brother Ren, who is currently playing with their little four year old sister, Erin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He flops down on the couch next to Eliza, who’s staring at her lock screen: a picture of the new pop star Justin Bieber as her background. She rapidly hides her phone away when he sits, pretending to fix her blonde hair and quickly braiding it. Louis can’t help but roll his eyes, playfully nudging her shoulder. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He often teases her about the small obsession with the singer, but after all, what would you expect from a fifteen year old girl? She just idolizes the boy, perhaps secretly hoping to date him someday. Who knows?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Okay, maybe not, Louis knows his sister isn't that naive, but sometimes when he stalks her Twitter, he is kind of terrified with her tweets. Also, he is getting sick of her always listening to "One Time" on repeat.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Okay, so I see that everyone's here," beams Natasha Tomlinson, turning her head to her husband, her brunette hair flying at the movement. Tristen Tomlinson returns her smile, wrapping an arm around his wife.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They look excited, albeit maybe a little nervous? Louis can't really tell. In any case, they're definitely up to something. They're looking between all the kids, eyes never settling down before looking at each other again, as if they are having a silent conversation. This is probably the case, because after seeing his parents married for years and having silent talks only through their eyes, Louis shouldn’t be surprised. Still, it's creepy, the way they silently communicate sometimes. Louis wonders if he’ll ever find someone that can understand him with a simple look.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mum, Dad, what is it?" a smooth voice inquires, and only now does Louis notice that the home phone is on speaker, his older sister Mary on the other line. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary is currently sleeping over at one of her best friends’, since they're all celebrating the fact they graduated high school and it's now summer time.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The matter must be quite important if their parents put her on the phone and didn't wait for her to come home. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Are you pregnant, mommy?" Ella, fourteen years old, asks innocently, her blue eyes staring at her mother as she rapidly blinks. Her mid-length straight hair is tied up in a messy bun that Eliza tried on her earlier, and she looks lovely. Not that Louis is biased, but all his sisters are pretty. Boys, and even girls, better watch out. They’ll have to go through him before they date any of his siblings.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Laughter escapes Louis’ mouth at Ella’s silly question, but he promptly chokes on his saliva when his mother doesn't immediately deny it. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You would think having <em>eleven</em> kids is enough, but apparently his parents never seem to want to stop. Louis knows they always planned to have a big family, and don't get him wrong - he deeply loves all his siblings, he loves having a big family, even if they have their ups and downs … But <em>surely</em>, eleven is enough? They'll have to stop one day, or else …</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mum?" Louis asks with a high pitched voice, his eyes widening. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha widens her eyes, shaking her head softly. "Oh, no! No, Ella, I'm not pregnant,” she replies, chuckling, cheeks reddening a bit.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis internally exhales in relief.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"However," his father takes over, squeezing his arm around his wife’s waist. “We do have something to announce.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What is it?" Daniel, thirteen years old, asks with a suspicious glare, narrowing his brown eyes under his cap. It’s his new style now, apparently. He has embraced this skater look, since his friends are all big boys, skating at the park. So of course Daniel has to do the same. His mid-length, curly, feather light brown hair is still wet from the shower he took earlier. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"We have a surprise!” Tristen says with a huge smile, flashing his teeth. “We are going to the lake house, to spend summer there,” he finishes, raising his arm in the air with an excited face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha looks between all the kids, a broad smile on her face, waiting for the children to react. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Some of them actually react happily to the news, babbling how excited they are. But Louis doesn't really feel the same. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“But ...” he cuts in he can finally speak up among the noise, frowning slightly. His parents’ eyes fall on him. “I had plan this summer,” he whines. His parents’ smiles falter. "I have gigs to attend, and I have to rehearsal with the band for the contest next year! <em>And</em> I was planning on going to that festival!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He knows he sound like a petulant child, but thankfully he isn't the only one here, as his older sister backs him up. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, guys!" complains Mary through the phone. "I have so many things to get ready for college, and so many projects I need to look up!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"And I wanted to see my friends this summer!" Eliza pipes in, with Daniel nodding in agreement. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen and Natasha look at each other, having another silent conversation.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I love the lake, I'm in!" a new voice chimes in through the phone, and Louis groans because <em>of course</em> his older brother Warren would be up for it. He’s always loved nature.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen claps his fingers at the phone, grinning in triumph. "BINGO!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza and Ella shake their heads, an entertained demeanor on their countenances. “All right, we're on board,” they say at the same time, which is creepy. Tristen cheers once again in response. Louis knows his father is going to win this.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I definitely wanna come!" Daniel answers, nodding his head. He seems now completely excited by the idea of going to the lake. He shares the love of nature with Warren.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The twins, Elizabeth and Nathan, nod, followed by Jeanne.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ugh,” Louis groans, propping an arm on his knee. He rubs his face against his arm, defeated.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ren shakes his brown hair out of his eyes before looking down at Erin in her laps, and the toddler smiles, nodding energetically with her wavy blonde hair flying around.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ren grins, gazing toward his father. "I think we agree, too!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen and Nat beam, and then everyone stares at Louis as his dad speaks up, “All right, that leaves you two… Lou and Mary.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Come on guys, it will be fun!" Daniel pleads, giving Louis his famous puppy face, and Louis looks away, avoiding his other siblings' faces, since he's certain they are all pulling the same face. Lucky Mary … She can't see their faces and yield.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But him? He does yield.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He sighs, shaking his head fondly. “All right!" he shouts, tossing his arms up in surrender, making his brothers and sisters bounce enthusiastically on their seats. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mary?" inquires Natasha with a hopeful voice, sparkling eyes staring at the home phone on the coffee table. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There's a short silence before the older girl sighs into resignation. "Fine!” she snaps. “As long as dad stops nagging me about me going to New York, I’m okay with going to the lake.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At the mention of his name, Tristen chews on his lips. He always has been extra protective when it comes to his children, which is normal. But… sometimes, it’s… too much. Really, he’s even worse than Natasha. She told Louis last time that his dad is like this because he isn’t ready to let his children go. That only makes Louis loves his dad even more.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha gives her husband a meaningful look, and the man pulls a face before sighing, clearly resigned. “All right!" he concedes, tone quickly regaining excitement. "Deal! We are going to the lake!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Louis calls his best friend to announce that he has to cancel Leeds, Stan isn’t being very helpful.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Shit, dude, that's a shame, the performers at Leeds are really going to be sick.”</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis sighs, staring at the ceiling while tightening his grip on his phone.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Ugh, I know! Well, at least Micky can go, since he’ll get my tickets … Good for him. It’s alright, really.”</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Except it really is not. Louis had been saving money for their ‘lads holidays’ for ages, and when he was <em>finally</em> about to go to England, to attend the famous Leeds Festival, everything crumbled. (Louis blames his cousin from Manchester, Matt, for seeding the idea in his brain in the first place.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>"Have you spoken to your cousin about it?" </em>demands Stan, interrupting Louis in his internal weeping.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"No,” he replies, rolling over on his bed. “I'll send him a message later and he'll get it in the morning.” He turns his head on the side when he hears his door being opened. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His mother's head appears in the doorway, and she silently asks if it's okay to come in. Louis nods and promptly ends his call, promising Stan to call him tomorrow before he leaves the following day. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He puts his phone away and sits on his bed, his mother taking a seat next to him. She gives him a look and bows down to pick up a dirty t-shirt on his bedroom floor.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis’ mother always runs through all the bedrooms to check up on everyone before she goes to sleep, and even if Louis is too old now for a bedtime kiss, it still makes his heart flutter, because she always makes sure to have time for every single of them. He loves his mother very much. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha smiles softly at him, playing with Louis' shirt in her hands. “You're really okay with going to the lake, right?" she asks, wincing slightly. She sounds unsure, unquestionably less certain than prior. Louis' protestations presumably affected her more than he thought.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Of course I am!" he quickly replies, grinning at her. "I love the lake! We did have great memories there.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At that, Natasha's smile widens, making some crinkles appear by her eyes. Apparently, Louis has the same crinkles. He doesn't really check himself on the mirror when he smiles or anything, but that's what Hannah told him once. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah, we did," she says softly, eyes warm. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"May I inquire as to why now?" Louis asks, a bit curious. They haven't gone to the lake in ten years, and Louis has extremely vague memories of the place, although he did know he had really great memories there. He knows he had fun at the lake, swimming in it, with their boats, when they were fishing, when they camped... All the outside activities possible, they did them all. Louis and his family used to go to the lake a lot, until it got to the point where the family became too crowded and they couldn't really afford it every year, or because his parents got caught up in work, everyone else busy with their new life when they first moved in West Virginia. It had been a genuine change for everybody.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha's expression changes into fondness as she slowly shakes her head. "Your father thought it was a good idea. You lots are growing up so fast now ...” she chuckles, sounding a bit teary. "Life goes so fast. We just thought…” she stops, shrugging. “That it would be great to go to the lake one last time. To get some time together.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis can't help but coo, because it certainly is a sweet attention. He wraps an arm around his mother's neck, and she leans into the hug, laughing. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Don't tell your father I said that," she starts in a whisper, "but he's kind of afraid that once you all are grown up, you'll leave forever and never come back to him.” She pulls away, rolling her eyes fondly. "You know how your dad is.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A smile tugs at Louis’ lip. He didn't really know his father would be this emotional. Sure he knows how much his dad loves his wife and children, knows how much he values family and how it is important to him. Now he understands why his father was so keen on taking this vacation. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well ...” Louis grins, voice full of malice and enthusiasm, "let's make it a big one then, shall we?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He has a good feeling about this summer. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">One hour and thirty four minutes is a long car journey when you're crammed together in the backseat, in a car full of other children. Louis knows this by experience.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That is the reason why Louis was <em>over the moon </em>when he found out that he was granted to shotgun with his brother Warren, the oldest of the family, in his brand new car.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is surprised to see how much Warren had changed. The last time Louis saw his brother; Warren’s hair was short, but now his straight brown locks reach his shoulders. There is a recent little scar near his right eye, and he informs Louis that this is the making of his recently adopted cat. Living by yourself in a brand new apartment must be very boring if Warren adopted a cat. He never was too fond of this animal before.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Joined by their sister Mary, the three siblings spend the driving catching up, Warren asking Louis about his band and school and stuff, while Louis inquires about Warren’s job at the garage to pay his bills while studying his ass off in college. His brother wants to have his own garage one day, and Louis doesn’t remember how his brother got this passion for cars, because Warren certainly didn’t get it from their dad.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">About their sister: Mary can’t shut up about New York and fashion shows during the whole journey, so Louis pretends to doze off at some point, not feeling bad in the slightest that Warren can’t do the same because he’s driving. He knows his brother has seen right through his subterfuge when he pinches Louis’ arm. Louis hides his smile, shutting his eyes harder while Mary goes on about some designer clothes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Finally, <em>fucking finally, </em>they arrive at their destination: Deep Creek Lake.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis rapidly gets out of the car, inhaling deeply, the smell of nature filling his nostrils and overloading his senses. That’s the thing Louis enjoys the most about the lake: the surrounding forests, the lake, of course, and the birds tweeting … Just the fresh air of the nature in general, without too much pollution around. Plus, the place is very cosy and familiar, almost a second home to Louis, despite the fact that it's been a very long time since he's been here.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Come on kids, come on," Tristen says excitedly, urging the kids to get out of the car while Natasha is unfastening Erin from her little red car seat. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis takes a look around, somewhat shocked to see that the place pretty much looks the same. It's the same house as in his memory, and he knows that behind the house is a path that leads right to the lake. Louis can’t wait to take a swim, it’s quite hot today. But first–</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Catch!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis startles and catches the backpack that Daniel tossed at him. Notwithstanding his great catch, Louis still manages to hit himself with the bag in the process. He glares at his younger brother, who bursts into laughter before shrugging at Louis innocently, pulling his own bag from the trunk.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"That's our house?" Ren asks with big eyes, gaping at the house. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Right, it's his first time here, as it is for most of the younger Tomlinson siblings. The others, with the exception of perhaps Warren and Mary, most likely don't recollect much either. Even Louis was a bit too little, just eight years of age.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It's a wooden house, with large windows and wooden support beams in front of the entrance, two lights on either side of the front door. The grass is all green, with bushes and some flowers decorating the sides of the property. The house doesn’t look that big from the outside, but Louis knows it’s bigger on the inside, with six bedrooms and bathrooms, several living rooms, and two stories with basement. There is also a garage. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, it’s ours,” Natasha answers with a beaming smile, leaning down to kiss Ren's head while managing to hold Erin in her arms and holding a bag in her other hand. Louis will always be astonished by her abilities. Never underestimate a mother. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen quickly helps her, taking the bag and pecking her on the mouth quickly, and Louis ought to be disgusted by his parents' behavior, but he can’t. They’re just that cute together. They've been a couple for so long, been married for almost the same length of time, and yet,  they still look at each other as if they were teenagers, as if they were meeting for the first time. As if they couldn’t believe how lucky they are.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They still act like a new married couple - they are sappy most of the time, more times than not embarrassing Louis when they act too sickly sweet around his friends, but Louis couldn't care less. They truly are adorable, and Louis really hopes he'll find someone who looks at him the way his father and mother look at each other. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A car honk shakes Louis out of his thoughts, and he swirls around just in time to spot a Hyundai pulling over.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A man steps out of the vehicle, and Louis watches as his dad shakes the man's hand, introducing Natasha by guiding her with a hand on her back. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It's Dean Smith," Warren says next to Louis, slipping his huge bag over his shoulder. "He's the owner of the lake and resort nearby.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis frowns slightly, tilting his head in thought. "I think I remember him.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Warren raises his eyebrows before clapping Louis on the shoulder and strolling towards the house, following the others. Louis' parents appear to be propelled in an enlivened discussion with that Smith, so he swiftly takes his luggage from the trunk and advances towards the house.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The main living room is gigantic, with a high ceiling and blue painted walls adorned with paintings of ships and sea. The floor is all wood, matching the outside of the house. The couches are the same color as the walls, only darker, and there’s a colossal stone fireplace, with several picture frames on the mantel.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Goodness, is that Louis?” Jeanne exclaims with a chuckle, taking a frame in her hands. Louis scrunches his nose. There must be embarrassing old pictures all around the house.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary stands behind her, looking over her shoulder. “Oh my god, yes, it’s Lou.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Jeanne turns her head, looking at his sister. “What happened to his tooth?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Football accident,” Mary replies, glancing at Louis. “You remember?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis raises an eyebrow. “My mouth remembers.” He looks at Jeanne. “Warren's football skills were as terrible as they are today, and I paid the price.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Warren snorts from the opened dining room. “Not my fault if you couldn’t catch the ball.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis drops his stuff on the stack of bags and is about to retaliate by throwing a pillow at Warren (yes, Louis is an immature child when he wants to be) when he hears a scream.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His head snaps up towards Eliza, who was the one who yelled, judging by her frightened expression.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What’s wrong?” Mary asks, looking around to find the reason of her scream.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“There’s a spider! There!” She points a finger towards the white coffee table, where an immense black spider can indeed be spotted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The grown-ups, which means Louis, Mary, and Warren, step up to take the situation into control, while Elizabeth takes refuge on the couch, her twin brother Nathan trying to calm her down. Elizabeth has arachnophobia, and Louis finds it sweet how Nathan always reassures her instead of throwing spiders at her, like Daniel would absolutely do.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The front door slams open, Natasha and Tristen appearing with Ren and Erin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What's wrong!?" Natasha inquires with wide eyes, putting a hand behind Erin's tiny head to somewhat protect her of the potential threat.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Warren lets out a chuckle. “It’s nothing, just a spider,” he replies, before smashing his foot on the table.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Just a spider?” Ella screeches, hands gripping her braid. Warren lifts his foot to her for good measure, earning a yelp from Ella and Eliza.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' ears are already bleeding because of his sisters' screams. This is going to be pleasant, if they act like this with every insect they encounter. They’re at a <em>lake</em>, for God’s sake.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Warren,” whispers Daniel with a smirk. “You put a stain on the table.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha, hearing that her white table has been damaged (Louis remembers she had painted white it a few years ago), looks over it and scowls at Warren, who shrugs. “I had to protect my family,” he answers gravely.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha rolls her eyes, shaking her head fondly. “All right, whatever. You kids get ready now.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Where are we going?” Ren asks lowly with a pitiful face. “Are we already leaving the lake?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha laughs softly at her boy, ruffling his hair. “No sweetheart, we’ve just arrived.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Indeed,” Tristen says with a wide grin. “And tonight we’re going to a barbecue,” he exclaims cheerfully.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Well, Louis does love a good barbecue. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After already making a mess of his shared bedroom with Warren and Daniel, Louis manages to pull out a decent outfit for the barbecue and styles his hair, and soon they're all set to go. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They arrive around 7:40 in front of a moderately-sized house that looks like an old castle from the outside. The little kids gasp at the interior, which is tremendous, done in colors that remind Louis of a mocha coffee. There a lot of people present, all dressed up to the nines, and Louis is glad he chose to dress up in all black, with his favorite "All Out" sweater, tight jeans and black shoes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As soon as the family enters, they're welcome by the owner Louis saw earlier. The man introduces himself at the kids, smiling broadly at them. He must see their hungry faces, because he promptly announces where they can find the food.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Alright kids," Dean Smith says with a chuckle. "Food's downstairs.” He points out to a door that seems to lead downstairs. He turns towards Natasha and Tristen with the same constant welcoming and friendly smile. "Mom and dad, the bar is this way.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' parents smile at the man, following him. But before Natasha leaves, she tosses a glance at her children, promptly reminding everyone to behave.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Warren squeezes his mother's arm. "Don't worry mom, Mary and I will keep an eye on the monsters.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"And I will, too," Louis interjects, making his mother smile and his brother chuckle.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He is not a kid anymore, thank you very much. Also, he has lost count of the many times he had to be the big brother while Mary was away and when Warren moved out. So yeah, he thinks he is responsible of his younger siblings.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They all head outside to a huge yard, with lot of tables and buffet. Someone is playing a violin somewhere, and kids and young teens are there, chatting happily together while their parents survey them from the balcony above them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There's a lake adjacent, and a few children are playing with a drenched dog. There’s a blonde lady in a pink dress attempting to get her son up off the ground, where the little boy seems to be having fun, rolling in the grass.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Louis! Louis!" Louis snaps out of his observation, turning towards his brothers Daniel and Nathan, whose faces look like two kids waking up on Christmas Day.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Look what they have," Dan exclaims joyfully, he and Nathan holding out a skateboard in their hands.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Can you show us how to do the kickflip again please?" Nat asks Louis with a pout, holding out another skateboard for Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis beams, accepting the skateboard with a nod. "Sure kiddos, but let's be careful yeah? I don't want Mum to yell at me again for making you bleed out.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Okay, so maybe Louis isn't always the most cautious, but hey… nobody’s perfect.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They have their fun with the skateboards for a while - Louis loses track of time. Eventually, they stop doing different tricks with their boards to pick up some food from the buffet, but after the food, they’re right back at it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the end, Louis gets exhausted and a short break would be more than welcome.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“All right boys, I'll be right back, okay?” The boys dismiss his notification by a wave of hands.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis spots his sister Eliza on her phone, sitting on a dock chair. He jogs to her and taps her shoulder, making her startle a bit as she lifts her head to look at him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I'm going to the toilets", he informs. "Look after Dan and Nat for me, will you?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza nods, immediately pocketing her phone and making her way towards her brothers, just in time to help Nathan off the ground, because apparently Dan thought it was a good idea to push Nathan from his skateboard.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">These boys…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After Louis ensures his brother isn't harmed, he heads towards the house, searching for the restroom. He is surprised to not spot a sign indicating where the bathroom is, so he stops a tall girl with short and straight brown hair in the hallway.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hey, sorry," Louis says, smiling at the girl. Her green eyes lands on him, raising her eyebrows.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She looks vaguely familiar, but Louis really can't remember where he's seen her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She looks at him expectantly, a cordial smile on her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Would you happen to know where the restroom is, by any chance?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The girl nods, pointing a finger at the end of the hallway, Louis following her gaze. "Just continue to the end, take the stairs and it's the second door on the right.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Thanks," he grins, glancing back at the girl who returns the smile before walking away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Surely, he finds the toilets easily. After he does his business, he promptly watches his hands.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That’s when he registers the sound of a flush and a door opening and closing behind his back. Louis shakes his hands to dry them, before turning away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He doesn’t expect to bump into someone.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He huffs a sound, blinking in confusion and stepping back in reflex. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Oops," a voice says. Louis' vision focuses on a tall curly haired boy with emerald eyes. The boy nibbles his lip, wide eyes looking at Louis with embarrassment. "Sorry, my bad," he says apologetically. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He has a nice voice, sort of deep, and Louis can’t tear his gaze from the green eyes. That's the first thing Louis notices: how green and bright they are. And afterward his gaze falls on the pink swollen lips, and he snaps out of his thoughts, blinking. <em>Oh god, stop staring Louis. It’s creepy.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He lets out a small chuckle. "Hi," he replies, smiling a little at the boy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The boy returns the smile, chewing on his lips and oh, god, he has dimples!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It's okay," Louis reassures quickly when he registered the boy’s apology. But despite his internal reprimand, he keeps staring at the boy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He just seems so familiar? Just like the hallway girl earlier – who, by the way, oddly looks like this boy – and Louis’ mouth has always been filter-free, so maybe that's why he blurts out the following words without thinking.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Do I know you?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The boy knits his brows together, his smile not leaving his face. "Erm, I don't think so?" His face goes from smiling to thinking deeply. "Although, you do look familiar.” The boy must register his words, because he shakes his head, before holding out a hand to Louis. "Hi, I'm Harry," he says with the same previous charming smile, dimples out and all. "Harry Styles.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And oh! Yes, of course. The Styles family.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis remembers them now.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Much the same as his own family, the Styles’ are regular clients at this lake resort, and Louis briefly remembers his young self playing with a little curly haired boy named Harry a couple of years back. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles broadly, shaking Harry's hand. "I'm Louis Tomlinson.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's eyes visibly widen in recognition, dimples displaying again as the boy beams. "Oh, I remember you now!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis can’t help but laugh brightly at that, also noticing they're still holding hands. "Yeah, I remember you as well. You made my little sister eat mud when we were kids.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's smile falls, his eyes widening in horror as he stares incredulously as Louis. "Oh my god … I did?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His expression is so comical that Louis can’t help it. He bursts into laughter, gnawing his lips and trying to calm himself. "Yeah,” he breathes out. “You did.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry purses his lips to stifle his giggle, but a chuckle escapes his mouth anyway. Then he seems to finally register their attached hands.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis watches as Harry’s cheeks turn pink, and they both drop their hands. Louis tries not to mourn the loss of contact. It’s not his fault this boy has a smooth hand, okay? Louis briefly thinks of the fact that Harry did just exit the toilet, and therefore didn't wash his hands, but whatever.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Sorry about that," Harry says, breathing out a small laugh. Louis isn't sure if he's talking about their hands or the memory. He probably is talking about the latter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It's okay, I'm sure she doesn't recall.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry giggles then, and the sound is too endearing. He shakes his head, and Louis is all of a sudden mesmerized by the curls falling before Harry’s eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I meant our hands,” Harry clarifies. “But I'm also very sorry about the mud part.” He winces. “I hope your sister doesn’t hold grudges.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis huffs a laugh, a small smirk touching his lips. “Don't worry. As I said, she probably doesn't remember.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Truth be told, it is possible that Eliza possibly remembers, because ever since, she’s been disgusted by mud, and nature in general, to be honest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry gives Louis an abashed smile, before advancing towards the sink, rapidly washing his hands. His eyes quickly meet Louis’ in the mirror, before he looks down at his hands once more.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There's a short silence, and although it's not an awkward one, Louis feels the need to fill in.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He folds his arms over his chest. "Speaking of sisters, I think I actually just ran into your sister a few minutes ago.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry pulls a paper to dry his hands, turning towards Louis. "Yeah?" he smiles.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah, she was wearing a green long dress?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry nods. "Yeah, it definitely was Erica. Now summer’s here, she won’t stop wearing dresses.” He shakes his head affectionately. "Girls and their clothes.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">All of a sudden, Louis' memory is stroke with a new souvenir. His lips curve upwards in amusement. "Weren't you the one who borrowed your sister's dress once? A Disney princess dress?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's eyes comically widens, before barking a laugh. "That was one time," he says in defense, both boys guffawing. "I can't believe you remember that.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hard to forget, dude," Louis retorts with a shrug, cheeks hurting from smiling so hard.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He vaguely remembers a small boy, holding up Cinderella dress to Louis before deciding to put it on. He thinks he can also remember Erica’s face contorted in both horror and amusement.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis doesn’t recollect much from the past summers, but he knows he had fun with Harry, in spite of the fact that the kid was a year younger than him. Louis thinks he recalls their family knowing each other pretty well, and he briefly wonders if his mum is aware that her friend Alice Styles is staying at the lake this year, too.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis and Harry mutually agree to finally leave the bathroom, making their own downstairs to join everybody outside. Harry then announces he’s starving, having not eaten yet, so he and Harry go to the buffet.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis opts for a homemade hamburger with some french fries. He raises an eyebrow when Harry decides to just eat a salad. Mind him, he chose a very a enormous plate stocked with cooked vegetables, seasoned with vinegar, but still. Louis feels like he eats junk food compared to him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Are you on healthy diet or something?" he asks inquisitively, biting onto his burger as he sits on a dock chair, Harry doing the same on another dock chair.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The curly haired boy shakes his head, bringing his fork to his mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"No, but I did spend a week at my friend's house before we left, and his older brother, who can’t cook for shit - basically stuffed us with fast food junk," he chuckles with a shrug. "I have to calm down a bit.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods, opting for not mentioning that he and his brothers often eats jerk foods (especially pizza) and that he could never stop. If you hand him a salad or some fries, he’ll have to choose the latter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Harry Styles.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Both boys look up from their plates, Harry turning his head to the person who’s called him. He’s frowning, before he recognizes the person and smiles at Eliza Tomlinson standing there, hands perched on her hips.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hi," Harry says after a swallow, beaming at her. He glances at Louis hesitantly, and the latter wonders if he recognizes her from that time he forced her to eat mud.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I don’t know if you recall who I am,” Eliza says, pursing her lips. “But you once forced me to eat mud," she finishes in a deadpan voice.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis chokes on his french fries, instantly laughing at Harry's appalled expression.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Errm," Harry says slowly, biting his bottom lip. He gives his what Louis thinks is his best contrite smile. "I'm so sorry?" He then pouts, <em>actually </em>pouts, and Louis watches as his sister's murderous look softens straight away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She drops her hands and stares at him in surprise. Then she smiles sweetly, pleased, and waves a hand at him. "It's okay, I forgive you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She observes Harry for a few seconds, fluttering her eyelashes at him and tugging a lock of hair behind her hair. And, uh oh, Louis knows that look. She's developing a crush on the boy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis knows he is not mistaking when she plops down without hesitation beside Harry, already trying to make conversation.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And of course, Harry answers all her questions, being the most polite and kind guy with her. He needs to stop encouraging her, for god's sake. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So Louis does the only thing he can think of. He clears his throat. “Don't you have to stalk Justin Bieber's twitter account or something?” he says, chewing aggressively on his french fries.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza gives him a bored look while Harry chuckles, glancing between him and Eliza. "Oh, you're a fan too?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis looks at him weirdly, wide-eyed. "Don't tell me you–"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shrugs, but shakes his head with a chuckle. “No, but my sister Tara adores him.” He glances back at Eliza. “I had to go to a concert with her and Erica.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Really?” Eliza asks, her eyes lighting up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry nods, and then he looks over Louis' shoulder. "Speaking of ... Tara!" he calls out, and Louis turns his head to spot a small girl with the longest curly haired he's even seen in his whole life.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The girl joins them, smiling at them. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Good evening," she greets sweetly, wrapping an arm around her brother’s neck. Harry puts his plate besides him, and the little girl instantly sits on his lap. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis and Eliza greet her with a smile and a wave of hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">See, a thing Louis has in common with Harry Styles is the fact they both have <em>large </em>families.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Okay, truth is, Harry's family is drastically less crowded than Louis', but he still has at least four siblings, if Louis remembers correctly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looks at his little sister with a fond expression. "Tara, darling, who’s Justin Bieber to you?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tara looks at him with a grin and a twinkle in her eyes. In the most sincere tone, she replies, "He is my husband.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles softly as Eliza giggles, Harry kissing his sister's cheek. "Don't you think nine years old is a little too young for him?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The little girl lifts a finger to her chin, thinking for a few seconds before pressing her lips together and shaking her head. "Nah.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis laughs, bumping Eliza's knee with his foot. "Well Eli, it appears there’s now some competition going on.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry throws him an amused smile, and they all joke a bit more about Justin Bieber before Tara eventually requests some water. Eliza volunteers to go with her, leaving Louis and Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is finishing his last french fries, hamburger long gone. He probably ate too much - the cooks were very generous with the portion, and he feels quite parched now.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">However, he is too lazy to move, so instead he lies down on the deck chair, gazing toward the sky. The sky is clear of black clouds, the stars illuminating the sky with the moon showing itself as well.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis could stay all night here, under the stars.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He hears Harry moving besides him on the dock chair, and surely when he glances at him, the boy is laying down, his eyes observing the sky as well.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"So ...” Louis starts, making Harry turn his head to look at him with a sunny smile. "Reminds me how many siblings you have?" he asks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry beams at the question. Just like Louis, he is proud and loves his huge family a lot.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well, there's little Tara you just saw, the youngest of the family,” Louis hums, smiling. “Then there’s Matthew, who’s just turned eleven. Vicky, who’s one year older than him. Then there’s Erica you saw earlier, and her brother twin William.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, that’s right,” Louis remembers, “they’re the oldest.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yep, twenty two years old, off to college and all,” Harry smiles.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"That's nice," Louis replies with a smile, running a hand through his fringe. He should have worn a beanie or something. He feels like his hair is a mess.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What about you though?" Harry sits upright, anchoring his gaze on Louis. "If I recall, your family is definitely bigger than mine.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis huffs a laugh. "That's an understatement.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So just like Harry did a few seconds ago, Louis lists his siblings. (The eldest boy of the family Warren, then Mary, Eliza, Ella, Daniel, Jeanne, Elizabeth, Nathan, Ren, and finally Erin.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It's always a surprise to people when Louis drops he’s not an only child. When they ask him how many siblings he has, they don't really expect him to answer ten. Their surprised expression are always expected. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">With Harry, it's the opposite, because he’s in the same position, and he just knows how it is with a big family.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Yeah, sometimes it sucks. Louis can’t have a quiet minute to himself, either because the younger siblings are yelling somewhere, or because he just can’t rest his ass somewhere without doing some chores or because he has stuff to do (homework mainly) and he has to look after Ren and Erin when his parents are at work and Mary can’t do it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Be that as it may, in spite of everything, Louis wouldn’t change a thing. They make it work, and when Harry tells him it’s exactly the same thing for him, he knows Harry just gets it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They talk more about their siblings, how they can be irritating sometimes but they both love them deeply. Then they move on to themselves, talking about school.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis learns that Harry is planning on studying law when he graduates, and during all his discussion with Harry, Louis notices how the boy is just so smart, and knows what he is talking about. He sounds determined and already has set his goal. It’s refreshing to see and talk to someone with big projects. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So Louis feels a bit ridiculous when Harry asks his future plans. He admits he isn't sure what to do yet, because at school he’s always been focused on soccer. He doesn’t know why, but he tells Harry that it’s always been his dream to play professional, but he knows it's just a silly dream. He even quotes his geography teacher, who once told him he would never amount to anything. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At that, Harry's face falls, his forehead wrinkled. "That was extremely inconsiderate of him to say that.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis just shrugs, making Harry’s frown deepens. "Maybe he's right.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry tilts his head astoundingly, looking genuinely offended on Louis' behalf. That kind of does something to Louis, making his heart jump in his chest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Do not ever think that, Louis," Harry says not unkindly. "Don’t listen to him. Where is the boy that once told me to never give up on your dream?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis frowns at that, before his eyes widen in both surprise and recognition. Louis had said that to Harry when they were younger, and Harry had confessed he wanted to become astronaut. He is honestly astounded by the fact that Harry remembers that. At that time, they were both innocent, thinking the world was within their reach. But life is so much difficult than that, and sometimes not every dream comes true.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You are a clever person,” Harry continues, “that doesn't seem to let things go easily. If soccer is your passion, then fight for it. If it's not meant to be, then so be it. And if it’s not your thing, you’ll find out eventually. It took me a while for me to find my path, you know. But my sister told me these exacts some words, and at first I didn’t believe her, but now I’m telling you the same thing because it’s true.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis can't resist the urge to grin at Harry's outburst and encouraging words. Harry himself seems to realize how he got carried away, because he visibly blushes, turning his head to look away. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Thank you, Hazza," Louis says softly, and he hopes his tone and look convey the appreciation he feels.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s head snaps at Louis at the old nickname, and he gives Louis a dimpled smile, the corner of his gentle eyes wrinkled.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They gaze at each other in silence for a short moment, before Harry slowly nods at Louis. “Anytime, Lou.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As the hours go by, Louis and Harry are so completely caught up in their bubble that they’re slightly startled when Mary walks to them, bursting the bubble. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She ruffles Louis’ hair with a smile. “We’re leaving, Loubear.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis glares at her, because she never uses this nickname, and <em>of course </em>she would use it in front of a cute boy. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He doesn't dare to look at Harry, but he's sure the boy must be grinning. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary glances at Harry. "Hi, you,” she says, sounding surprised, as if she hasn’t registered his presence. “You must be Harry Styles," she smiles, and Harry swiftly stands up, holding out his hand. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hi! Yes, pleasure to see you," he responds with a broad and charming smile, polite as ever. Honestly, how can someone <em>not </em>fall for the boy? He’s just <em>that </em>charming.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And let's not forget the curls.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis cannot resist the curls.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary's smile widens, and she shakes his hand, glancing knowingly at her brother. "Likewise, Harry. I'm really sorry, but we need to hurry up,” she addresses to Louis, giving him a small regretful smile. "Erin is throwing a tantrum.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis lets out a sigh small, getting up. "Alright, I'm coming.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He raises a discreet eyebrow at his sister, who thankfully gets the hint and leaves them alone, not without throwing him a sly smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry turns to him, face wreathed in smiles. "Well, it was nice to see you again, Louis.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah," Louis says in the same tone, grinning.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Truly, he spent a great night. He didn’t even notice that time passed by, too caught up with Harry Styles. He hopes the Styles’ house is near his, so that they can hang out sometime. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As if reading his mind, Harry speaks up, "Which house is yours?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The name’s Enchanted Lakefront.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The houses around the lake are all named, and Louis’ parents chose that basic name when they became owners of the lake house.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The curly haired boy beams. "Cool, mine is on the other side of the lake, called Stonegate.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Cool," Louis echoes with a grin, and honestly what the fuck. He feels like a teenager having a crush, being excited by the idea of hanging out with the boy he fancies. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Chill, Louis.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well, then,” Louis says, standing up. “I guess I’ll see you around, Curly.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry nods enthusiastically, the corners of his mouth rising. “I guess so. See ya, Lou.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If in only one simple evening, they’re already on nickname basis, Louis wonders how the next weeks are going to be. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He can hardly wait to find out. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is brushing his teeth is one of the bathrooms upstairs when Mary enters without knocking.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He busies himself drinking his glass of water, because he already knows what his sister is going to say, if the knowing and amused look she's giving him is anything to go by. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But instead of saying her thoughts aloud, Mary acts innocent, applying toothpaste on her pale green toothbrush. She gives Louis another smirk, before raising an eyebrow at him and beginning to brush her teeth. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis sneers and rolls his eyes, wiping his mouth with a towel as he hears his mother on the other side of the door, barking at Daniel to go to bed and stop running in the house. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"So how do you find Harry?" Mary inquires out of the blue around her toothbrush. She laughs at Louis' unimpressed look.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He chooses to ignore her and instead leaves the bathroom, but not before giving her a gentle tap on the back of her head.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He hates when his sister teases him, because she certainly isn't going to let go of this. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Even as he closes the bathroom door, his sister's laughter rings in his ears. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is fucked.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The following morning consists of Tristen joyfully serving breakfast while Natasha gives everyone their toast, making it impossible for Mary to eat her own food as she struggles to make Erin eat her breakfast. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So Mary quickly gives up, letting out a defeated sigh and tossing the spoon to Warren, with Warren is sitting close to her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I give up,” she groans. “It’s your turn. It'll give you some practice for your future child.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At her comment, Warren's eyes almost bulge out, and Louis can't smother his giggling, gagging on his orange juice.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I don't think me and Emma are ready for that," Warren says slowly with a restrained voice, carefully lifting the spoon to Erin's mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The little girl pulls away at the sight of the spoon, grimacing. Warren’s face is a mixture of horror from Mary’s previous remark, and despair regarding Erin’s morning conduct. Louis can’t help but snort again behind his glass. It must have been quite some time since Warren had to deal with a toddler, because he seems like a lost puppy. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis decides to jump to his help. “You do realize she is not a baby, she's four. She can actually eat by herself," he says. “She doesn’t like being treated like a child. She’s a big girl, aren’t you Er?”, he coos, stroking Erin's smooth cheek with a finger.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Erin beams at him, letting out a ‘ya’, before taking the spoon from Warren's hand, diving it in her bowl of cereal and splashing some milk while doing so. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Louis, d’ya want some toast?" Natasha asks from the opposite side of the table, still serving everybody’s breakfast. He nods, efficiently catching the toast she throws at him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It's kind of a habit in their family to throw things at each other's faces. They have their routine amid meals, and so far it’s always worked fine. Even if sometimes Louis ends up being hit with a toast in his head now and then, or when Nathan spills his glass of orange juice most of the times. This kid is honestly too clumsy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"So, what do you guys wanna do today?" Tristen enquires with a huge smile, unmistakably in a jovial mood already. He’s sipping on his coffee, glancing at his kids. "What would you say about doing some family activities!?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Actually...” Eliza trails off, biting her lips, "I was going to go to town, doing some shopping with mom, Anne Styles and her daughters.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And with me, too,” Ella cuts in with wide eyes, scared they’d forget about her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen takes a gander at his wife as if she’s betrayed her somehow, then looks back at his daughter and pouts, actually pouts, like a kid. "You’ve got all vacation to do shopping.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza looks clearly offended at that. "We have all vacation to do the family activities, too.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis bites back a sneer by eating his cereals, averting his gaze to the lake, seeing a few people on the opposite side, climbing on a boat. He’s almost certain that this is the Styles residence.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His brain automatically goes to think of Harry, and what his plans might be today. Louis wonders if perhaps they could hang out together.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It's only ten in the morning, but it's very warm already  and the sky is entirely blue, the lake sparkling under the beams of sunlight. Louis cannot wait to go take a swim.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What about you, Louis?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mmh, what?” Louis turns his head to look at his father, who's looking at him expectedly, nearly with pleading eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You're gonna go fishing with your old man, aren’t ya?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Uh-uh, no way Louis is going fishing. He<em> hates </em>fishing. His father knows that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He grimaces at the prospect, shaking his head. “Take Dan with you, he's the one who loves fishing.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Daniel’s head perks up, forehead wrinkled as he looks at Louis in clear confusion. “I thought you were going to teach me some skate tricks today?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We'll do that later, okay buddy?” Louis replies, nodding his chin at his father. “You can't let our father down, he won't be catching any fish without your assistance.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Dan snorts at that, appearing to consider it before promptly shrugging and nodding. Their father gives Louis a look, but quickly smiles because at least someone is definitely going without a fuss. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis takes another sip of his juice, pleased with himself. That’s the perk of having a big family - when you don’t want to do something, you can always ask your sibling.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Twenty minutes later and Louis finds a deserted place on the shore by the lake, so he settles down on some large rocks, notebook in hands as he starts writing some lyrics down. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It's nothing great, just some sentences that go through his mind now and then. Sometimes, he haphazardly starts humming a melody to himself, and he finds that some words just fit together, and eventually he can make out a song out of his ideas.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He’s drumming his right foot on the ground, smiling to himself and totally relaxed under the hot sun. He’s wearing green and grey shorts, with a sleeveless white top and a cap covering his messy hair.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the distance, he can hear Elizabeth and Jeanne having a water gun fight with Nathan and Daniel, and the sound of their laughter warms Louis' heart. He stops writing for a while to observe the enormous lake spread before them, the view too good to pass up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He then hears some turbulence in the water, and soon enough, Louis spots a male figure making his way through the water, a familiar wet brown curly-head popping above the glassy surface of the lake. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry can't see him, and he's most likely too far to hear Louis, so the latter just sits there in silence, watching as the boy swims away from him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis goes back to his writing.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Just before lunch, after Louis’ sister and mom come back from their shopping session, Natasha reports that they’re all invited to the Styles residence, as Harry’s younger brother's birthday party is tomorrow. In the meantime, Trent and Alice Styles said the Tomlinson kids are welcome to come at their cottage to play with the Styles kids any time they want.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So Louis and his siblings eat their lunch in eagerness, happily babbling about how they’ll get to play on the big floating trampoline Harry's dad purchased. The Tomlinson kids spend the day at their neighbor’s on the opposite of the lake.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis remains at home, tanning outside on a towel with his blue swim trunks on. He’s on Erin duty, the little girl sat alongside him under the parasol. She’s wearing a pink hat, and is engrossed in her toys, playing with some dolls and occasionally including Louis in her imaginary adventures.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He is rapidly lifted up from this duty when his mother thuds down on the towel and kisses him on the head, ordering him to go have some fun, because it's his vacation too. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis grins at her and happily obliges. He goes up to his room to slip some trousers on; takes his backpack, and grabs a water bottle from the fridge. He leaves the property by yelling he's going to explore the woods, getting a thumbs-up from his mom in response.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He follows the path leading behind the house and goes on about twenty minutes before he needs a break. Thankfully, he finds a wooden table with benches nestled in the forest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His gaze falls on the lake, river really, where the water is whirling. There’s a waterfall tumbling from a rock wall, and Louis is blown away by his surroundings. It’s so beautiful and peaceful, the sound of the waterfall roaring and crashing, the river rushing. Occasionally, he hears a few birds tweeting, and Louis has never dreamt of a better place to feel at peace and find inspiration.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So he sits on the bench facing the river, slipping off his bag to drink some water and then quickly pulls out his notebook from his bag, biting his lip in concentration as his pen starts scribbling, almost as if it has a life of its own.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He is so caught up in what he is doing that he doesn't hear or see a familiar boy swimming toward the riverside.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey there, Tomlinson,” a voice says.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis’ head snaps up, meeting Harry’s broad smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's dripping body emerges from the water, and he shakes his wet curls out of his face, running a hand through his hair to push it back completely. He looks like a wet puppy, but a shirtless puppy, and he’s wearing the smallest pair of yellow swim trunks Louis has ever seen. His chest is starting to get tan, as Louis can see a sliver of his waist that’s slightly paler than the rest of his torso, and Louis’ eyes can’t help but wander over the skin, where he spots two marks that strangely look like an extra set of nipples.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles at him, however raises an eyebrow at the formality. “So now we're back on the surname basis?” Just yesterday they were calling each other nicknames, and Louis would be lying if he said he wasn’t a little disappointed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry wiggles his eyebrows, sitting down on the bench in front of Louis, his back facing the river. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shakes his head, folding his arms on the table. "So what's up, Styles?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well, <em>Louis,</em> I'm just enjoying a nice afternoon in the woods," Harry answers.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Decent swim?” Louis asks with a smile, putting down his pencil.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The most delightful,” Harry sighs cheerily.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis huffs a laugh at that. He can relate. He hasn’t even taken a swim yet, what blasphemy. “Do you often go swimming?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, it helps me to loosen up,” the curly haired boy answers, beaming at Louis. “I actually am part of the swimming club at school.” Louis is not even surprised. “Don’t you swim?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shrugs, his fingers toying with his pencil. “Mmh, I do, yeah, but not that much. I actually haven’t been able to put a foot in the water yet.” He laughs at Harry’s widening eyes. “I know, outrageous right? But me and my brother might go on a boat trip later.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's green eyes, as green as the forest around them, perk up at that. “Oh! Will and I planned to do that, too. Dunno when precisely, but you can join us if you want,” Harry proposes, dimples appearing on his cheeks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis cocks an eyebrow, grinning. “Yeah, I'd love to.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’ smile widens, before his eyes widen in realization. "You should give me your number!” He must register his words then, because his eyes go even wider, ready to bulge out. He quickly corrects him, "I-I mean, so that I can text you next time,” he says quickly. “You know, so that I can let you know when we'll do some boarding,” he mumbles, cheeks reddening as he looks away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis chuckles brightly and decides to take mercy on him. “Sure thing, curly.” He tears a page off his his notebook, writing down his number and handing it to Harry. “Here we go. You’ll have to text me.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s smile turns bashful at that. “Will do.” He then looks down at Louis’ notebook. “You draw?” he asks, looking up at Louis with expressive eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis glances down at his book quickly, feeling suddenly vulnerable. He doesn’t really talk about his songs, just to his mom.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I, erm, I write songs.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Really?” Harry exclaims enthusiastically. Then he must sense Louis’ discomfort, because he quickly adds, “I’m not going to ask you to show them to me, don’t worry. But it’s very cool!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles widely at that. “Thanks.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry returns the same. “I, myself, have an artistic soul,” he says with a solemn voice, the corners of his eyes wrinkled, and for some reason, Louis can’t stop smiling. “I like to paint. Mind you, I'm not that good, but eh. Drawing is also one of my passions, of course.” He shrugs, pleased nonetheless.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What do you draw?" Louis asks with interest, propping his elbows on the table. His brain starts imagining Harry painting, a brush on his hand and a pallet in the other one.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's amused eyes turn mischievous. “Don't move, Tomlinson.” And he takes Louis’ pen, carefully tearing up the corner of the page Louis wrote his number to draw on the rest of the page.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis widens his eyes when he realizes that Harry is serious. He shakes his head, chuckling slowly. "Uh-uh, no way you're drawing me.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry pouts at Louis, bottom lip out and all. He looks adorable, and that makes Louis’ stomach feel something. "Please...” Harry begs, batting his eyelashes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis huffs a laugh, but he knows he’s going to give in. “Do you often ask to draw people like that?” he mumbles, before taking a dramatic pose, one elbow propped on the table, hand in his hair, chin raised. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It's a ridiculous pose, but Harry seems to enjoy it, his mouth twitching, fighting a smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Very nice,” he gives Louis a thumb up, before sitting upright, face suddenly turning serious and focused. Then, to answer Louis’ previous questions, he whispers, almost as if he doesn’t want Louis to hear, “I only draw pretty stuff.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He drops that as if it's no big deal, and Louis' whole body could very well burst into flames at that. His cheeks are probably red, and he tries his best to stay stoic and not let anything show on his face. Meanwhile, Harry bites his bottom lip, brows knitted together in concentration, and he starts drawing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>This kid is both cheeky and adorable</em>, Louis thinks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry must spend at least forty minutes drawing him, every two minutes ordering Louis to stay still, but of course Louis, true to himself, can’t stop talking or moving a hand, passing it through his quiff. And every time, Harry shakes his head, a constant smile plastered on his face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So yeah, if it amuses Harry, then Louis won't stop messing around. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They talk for God knows how long, discussing their hobbies, and Louis learns that besides painting and drawing, Harry likes photography. He seems like to be a very creative person, and when Louis asks why Harry chose to go to law school instead of an art school , the boy shrugs and confides these are more hobbies, and that he is quite interested to study law in order to become a lawyer. He also confessed he considered training to be a physiotherapist for a while, before dropping this career idea. Louis is amazed at how much of a go-getter Harry is. He has no doubt that Harry will succeed in whatever he decides to go for.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Then Harry decides he wants to hear more about Louis (since he hasn’t finished drawing Louis’ mouth and all, so he is free to talk) and Louis just doesn’t stop talking after that. Harry seems very concentrated on his drawing, yet he manages to make Louis feel like he only has his attention on him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis tells Harry about some pranks he pulled during his high school years, like that time he and his best friend Stan did the famous glue prank and their math teacher was stuck to his chair. Or that other time they rang the fire bell on accident, or that time where one of Louis' friends, after a challenge, got stuck in one of the giant trees in the schoolyard. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry giggles at every one of Louis' witty remarks, and laughs loudly at Louis' jokes. Louis really doesn't know if he’s that funny and Harry finds him genuinely entertaining, or if Harry is just too kind and polite. But every single chuckle from Harry makes Louis’ heart swell with pride.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In turn, Harry talks about the fact that <em>he</em> is usually the one who gets pranked, and he tells Louis about the time one of his mates taped his hands to his desk, and that Harry struggled for at least ten good minutes before finally getting free. Louis can’t help but burst into laughter, picturing a poor young curly-haired boy struggling with his taped hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Then the conversation drifts to Harry’s friends, and that promptly leads to Harry telling Louis he’s formed a band with his friends.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' eyes go at the revelation. "Really?” he exclaims excitedly. “I, myself, am in a band!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looks up from his paper, pencil stopping on the page. His mouth stays agape as he stares at Louis in surprise. “Really?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shakes his head vigorously. “Yeah! We’re called The Rogue. We kind of sing seductive lyrics and quirky music, and we perform on electronic instruments,” Louis says with a shrug. “During live performances for school, we often use pyrotechnics to accent the show.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's eyes fall on the paper as he nods, smiling. “That's sick. Me and my band mates – Haydn, Nick  Will – are called White Eskimo.” He rolls his eyes at Louis’ snort he couldn’t stop. “I know, it's a silly name,” Harry chuckles, shaking his head in fondness nonetheless. “Anyway, we are going to a try out for a singing competition next year.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What, really?" Louis exclaims again disbelievingly. "So are we!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry cocks an eyebrow in surprise, and they both quickly find they have more than big families in common. After trading stories about their respective band, they start talking about music in general (Louis tells Harry his favorite band is The Fray whereas Harry's is Coldplay), and they drift to what kind of stuff they listen to. Louis quickly notes that Harry is a bit of wannabe hipster, and when he dares to say so, Harry feigns to be offended before giggling (and what a beautiful sound it is). </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I grew up listening to my dad's stuff, really,” Harry says to his defense, half-shrugging.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis chuckles. “I definitely don't listen to my dad's stuff, we have completely different tastes.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They obviously start asking about their favorite bands, and then Louis mentions about that band he was supposed to go see at Leeds in England this year.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At this ordinary revelation, Harry stops drawing, staring at Louis with wide eyes as if he just told him the most extraordinary thing ever. “You’re joking, right?” he asks, sounding and looking bewildered.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No I am not?” Louis answers, frowning slightly. “Why?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry lets out a breathless laughter. “Wow, that's... That's so weird! I was planning on going too.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What?" Louis breathes out, shocked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They both live in America, and out all the cities in England, Harry was going to go to Leeds, too? Louis has always been a believer in fate, but this is a whole new level of shit right now. His mother’s side of family lives in England, so Louis actually has an excuse to visit. But Harry…? Wow.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He doesn't mention that out loud though, and they keep discussing about music before changing the subject to movies and TV shows, Louis confessing how obsessed he is with Breaking Bad. However, Harry admits he never watched it, and Louis gasps at him, promising to Harry he'll make him watch someday, because “seriously Harold, you’re missing on something, how can you not have watched this show!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis hasn’t clicked with anyone this fast in ages, and it’s so refreshing and nice to talk to someone like Harry. And, Louis has to admit, he is kind of mesmerized by the way Harry behaves in general.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And yes, it's creepy, the way Louis is probably staring at Harry when the latter isn't watching, but it's just... Since Harry is totally concentrating on his drawing, he has the habit of slightly parting his lips opened, and sometimes he’d lick his lips and run a hand through his almost dry hair.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">While his eyes travel to Louis' face to draw him, he sometimes look at Louis straight in the eyes, and Louis feels his cheeks getting warmer every time. Louis usually doesn't like making eye contact for too long, but he discovers he doesn't really mind with Harry… Sweet Harry, who has warm emerald eyes, eyes so green that Louis would happily get lost in the forest of them. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Okay, so maybe Louis has spent too much time watching Harry, but the boy is cute, okay? </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They're just done talking about the last Lost episodes when Harry adds the final touch to his drawing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Here we go,” the boy finally concludes, resting his pen down. He smiles at his drawing one last time, looking satisfied, before turning the drawing to show Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And… wow. Louis hasn’t expected this, at <em>all</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Wow,” he breathes out, his eyes glued to the drawing in astonishment. “It's amazing, Harry,” Louis says in awe.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Somehow, Harry managed to draw Louis to the very last detail, from his crinkles by his eyes to the corners of his mouth (because of course Harry drew Louis when the latter was smiling hard). Harry even drew some freckles on his cheeks - Louis had actually forgotten he had them until that moment. Harry drew his long eyelashes, his thin lips, and his apparently sharp cheekbones. The portrait is just so incredibly well drawn, and so beautiful.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis has a hard time believing the person drawn is supposed to be him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Not only the drawing is very detailed, but Harry also played with the light and shadow, coloring more some places to highlight other things.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I like the way you made me look like I’m glowing, even with only a pencil,” Louis says, not taking his eyes off the drawing. “I wish I was as vibrant as that.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You are, though,” Harry replies simply.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mmh?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You are vibrant, and… flamboyant.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Finally, Louis anchors his attention on the talented boy. Harry is watching him as if he just can’t believe he got to draw something so beautiful. And Louis feels like he’s on fire.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Stop saying nonsense, curly,” Louis shots quickly, letting out a shy giggle. He bows his head down, to somehow hide his pink cheeks. At this moment, Louis wishes he had a sunburn, so that Harry couldn’t tell how red his face was from his words.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shakes his head in turn, tusking at Louis. “I'm only stating the truth,” he says genuinely. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Why is Harry so… Harry?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis can’t go further in his internal thoughts, because then his phone starts ringing in his back, signaling he has a new message. When he pockets it out, he realizes it’s already six thirty.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, shit,” he curses. “I didn’t see it was that late.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry winces. “Yeah, I better get back. I don’t even my phone with me.” He takes the piece of paper with Louis’ phone number written on it and stands up from the bench.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis follows suit, slipping his backpack over his shoulder. "Well, I’d better go, too," he says, with a small smile. He doesn’t really want to go, if he’s being honest with himself. He was having a great time with Harry here.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He isn’t sure, but with Harry’s torn face, Louis hopes Harry feels the same.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah,” Harry says in answer, “I, erm, I promised my mom I would help baking a cake for Matthew tomorrow.” He cocks his head on the side, looking at Louis in question. “You and your family are coming, right?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods. “Yes, Mom mentioned it at lunch earlier today.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry immediately perks up at that, shooting a white-teeth smile at Louis. “Alright, then I guess I’ll see you tomorrow, Louis.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis doesn't know why he feels that pleased when Harry pronounces his names.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh,” Harry adds. “And you keep the drawing,” he says with a wink, then he waves at Louis and leaves without another word.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis stays still a few seconds, smiling to himself. He grabs Harry's beautiful drawing, observing it for a few minutes. His heart is jumping happily in his chest, and his cheeks feel warm and hurt a little because he can’t stop smiling.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So what if he doesn’t stop smiling like an idiot until he arrives at his house? No one can blame him. He hides Harry’s drawing in his nightstand, and lies on his bed, thinking of the day ahead tomorrow.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He cannot wait.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A few minutes later, consisting of Louis daydreaming, and he’s already pulled out of his peaceful reverie.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His mother calls him frown downstairs, and he immediately obliges, stepping into the kitchen. He finds his sisters Eliza, Ella and Elizabeth (or as Louis likes to call them, the Three Els) with Jeanne.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The three Els appear to be sulking, with Eliza on her phone with a deflated face, while Ella is chewing on some chips with a resigned expression. Then there’s Jeanne, excitedly agitating her hands. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Come on girls," she exclaims cheerfully, nudging Eli's shoulder. “It's going to be fun!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What is?" Louis inquires, stealing Ella's chips from her hand. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hey!" the poor girl protests, instantly glaring at Louis who smirks in response.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Tonight we’re camping! And eating papa's fishes!” Jeanne tells Louis with a grin, while Ella and Elizabeth groan in unison.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"<em>You </em>guys are camping," Eliza interjects, not taking her eyes off her phone. "There is no way I'm participating in this.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Come on, honey," Natasha cuts in with a bored voice (which means they’ve had this discussion for a few minutes now). She gently pinches Eliza's waist. "It's going to be fun.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The brunette girl rolls her eyes, shaking decisively her head. "I am <em>not</em> going to camp.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis arches an eyebrow, as if to say ‘really’. He can’t wait for his father to prove her words wrong.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Because when their father has something in mind, it's hard for him to let go. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So here they are, two hours later, sat around a fire (that took forever to light up) after setting up all the tents.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They're eating as true campers tonight; as it turns out, Tristen Tomlinson managed to catch some trout, and the poor animals are currently being cooked over the fire in a foil parcel. Louis doesn’t really like fish, but he must admit that this recipe is rather good. The fish were seasoned to taste with salt and pepper, and then their cavities were stuffed with butter, green peppers, and garlic. And Louis can never say no to a good potato recipe as well.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The kids are all excitedly talking about their afternoon at the Styles’, Nathan babbling proudly how he finally mastered the art of diving thanks to Harry's oldest brother, Will. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis has vague memories of Will Styles, and he looks forward to seeing him again for their boarding session, as Harry had mentioned earlier. Louis can’t help but think back to his afternoon he spent with Harry, and he tries to hide his grin by hiding behind his potato.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Unfortunately, he isn’t being very discreet, because Daniel nudges his shoulder.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What are you smiling at?" the little boy asks nosily.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis quickly drops his smile, squaring his shoulders as he clears his throat. "Nothing,” he says. “Did you have fun today with Dad?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is glad Dan is still little, or that he just likes to talk about himself, because he doesn't notice how Louis tries to change the subject. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The little boy beams and starts telling Louis how many little fish he got. The night goes on quickly, except for the part where Erin spotted a spider on the ground and tried to eat it. Other than that, the night flies by without any incidents. They even sing a few campfire songs before finally going to sleep in the tents at eleven o’clock, the younger kids already fast asleep.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis stays up a bit more, contemplating the moon’s reflection on the lake. The stars are shining above, and it’s honestly so stunning. Inspiration hits him, and he pulls up his little notepad on his phone.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He is so taken in his creative process that he startles in a jump when he hears a twig snap.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He looks at the purple tent, and spots his sister Eliza carefully zipping up the tent. She turns around and jumps when she spots Louis, who's been watching her silently, waiting for her to notice him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Fucking hell," she exclaims with a hushed voice, hand flying to her heart.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What are you doing?" Louis whispers back, narrowing his eyes at her. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The girl drops her hand and glares at him, before flipping her hair behind her shoulder. "I'm going to bed. Good night.” And without another word, she makes her way towards the house.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis can’t suppress his giggle, amused by his sister's behavior and stubbornness, a famous personality trait in the Tomlinson family.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When he finally enters his own tent, it’s dead silent, except for Daniel's snores. Louis makes sure he doesn’t crush Nathan's arm when he lies down, and the latter snuggles closer to his big brother, making Louis smile as he closes his eyes. He falls asleep, lulled by the animals of the night and the nature.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Around 12:45 the day after, they drive to the Styles' house for Matthew Styles’ birthday. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is kind of looking forward to meeting Harry's parents and his rest of siblings, since he only spoken to Tara and Erica briefly so far. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As soon as his dad parks the car, Louis' family is wholeheartedly welcomed with Alice Styles, beaming at the Tomlinsons with open arms. She’s wearing a long green pepper dress, setting off her pale green eyes, and her mid-length curly brown hair is down around her shoulders, a warm smile lighting her face up. Louis can spot a dimple, and he is not surprised.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Welcome to Stonehague,” she welcomes with joy, and soon enough, Trent Styles and the six Styles children are all greeting the Tomlinsons with hugs and handshakes. Louis briefly sees Harry, and they make eye contact before Louis is pulled into a tight hug by Harry’s mother.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' mum, of course, thanks Alice for inviting them. "And of course," Natasha says, beaming, "happy birthday to Matthew!" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Matthew Styles waves at them shyly, throwing a toothless smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"How old are you now?" Louis' father asks the boy cheerfully, who proudly answers, ‘I’m turning eleven!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Wow, you're a big boy now, aren't you?" Tristen exclaims, making the little Styles boy nod contently. "You're the same age as Elizabeth and Nathan!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' dad encouragingly pushes the twins forward, and just like that all the kids spread into groups, while Harry's parents apparently propose a house tour for Natasha and Tristen.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Oh, that reminds me," Tristen exclaims, raising a finger in the air. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He goes to the car and grabs something from the glove compartment, presenting a wine bottle to Trent, who immediately beams at that. "Oh, Tristen! You didn't have to.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hey Lou!" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis turns from his parents and the Styles’, facing Harry Styles, who’s smiling at him. He’s wearing a pale pink denim jacket with jean short and sandals.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis instantly returns the smile, his mind going crazy at the nickname. He doesn’t know why he gets this odd sensation in his entire body whenever Harry pronounces his name or calls him "Lou". It's not like Louis’ friends don't use this nickname as well, but there's just something in the way Harry says it that makes Louis feel good inside.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Truly, he doesn't know why he's acting like a 16-year-old girl. He needs to get his act together. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hi, Styles," he smirks, not giving Harry the satisfaction of a nickname. Harry lets out a snort at that, giving him a knowing smile. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You're still up for some boarding?" Harry asks, glancing at a tall man approaching them. He has short brown hair and familiar green eyes. <em>That must be Harry’s older brother, then</em>, Louis thinks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hi," the young man says, holding his hand out to Louis with a familiar dimpled smile (do all the Styles have dimples!?). "You must be Louis.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods, shaking the offered hand. "Hi, and you must be William.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">William’s lips curve upwards, the corner of his eyes wrinkled. "Yeah, you probably don't remember me well?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shrugs. "A little,” he admits. “It's been a while.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, that's true,” Will chuckles and claps a hand on his brother's shoulder. "Harry told me you'd like to join us for some boarding?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis glances to Harry, who's watching him with a broad smile. He nods at Will. "Yes, if it's okay with you, of course!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Sure, man, no problem," Will confirms delightedly. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Cool,” he answers cheerfully. "Then I'm definitely in.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">William nods at him with a grin, walking backward as he throws a thumb up at him. "Tomorrow, 2pm. I'll swing by your house on the boat.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis responds with a thumbs up, and Will gives him one last dimpled smile before turning away and joining Mary Tomlinson. Louis watches as his sister interacts with the boy. He remembers when they were all younger and Mary had a massive crush on Will. He wonders if she feels any different. Probably - after all, a lot of time has passed since they’ve last seen each other.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When he looks at Harry, the boy is smiling, one dimpled displayed. Louis wants to poke that dimple, but he restrains himself. He wonders if Harry guesses his internal thoughts, because he’s now smirking, looking amused. But there’s no way he knows, right?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Come on,” Harry says through his grin, clear amusement obvious in his tone. Louis chooses to ignore it. “I'll show you around.” </span>
</p><p class="p1" align="center">
  <strong>
    <span class="s1">**</span>
  </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Styles' house is not as big as Louis’. It’s a single family home with four bedrooms, 4 full and one partial bathrooms. The lakefront home has a beautiful view of the lake, and Louis notices during the tour that almost all the rooms have a view. The kitchen is very large, and when Louis and Harry stop by, Harry’s sister Vicky seems to be doing some baking preparation, joined by Louis’ sisters (the three Ls + Jeanne).</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis never really spent much time at the Styles’ house, but the part he does remember is the grand outdoor space, with a wood fireplace and a covered deck. Oh, and there’s a hot tub too, apparently.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The hot tub is from last year,” Harry explains when he notices Louis’ gaze. “Erica and Mom could spend their days in it.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis chuckles, thinking he really doesn’t blame them. “What about you?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry gives him a whimsical look. “I’m content with the lake.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Speaking of the lake, after they finally finish the house touring, they waste no time and spread some towels by the lake, lying down. They watch their younger siblings in the distance, jumping on the trampoline, their laughter and screams echoing in the nature. They could be left in peace, but instead Louis and Harry find themselves invaded by bees sometimes, making Louis flinch every time.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Which, of course, makes Harry laugh every time. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What," Louis says on the defensive, going back to his lay down position once he's sure the fucking bee is no longer around. "I hate bees.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shakes his head – as much as he can while resting it on the towel – and closes his eyes because of the sun. (When Louis asked Harry why he’s not wearing sunglasses, Harry said that his nine-year-old sister Tara broke them). "They're harmless you know, Lou.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis raises himself and props one elbow, looking down at Harry with raised eyebrows. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry must feel the intensity of his look, because he opens his eyes with difficulty, turning his head to look at Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You wouldn't say that if you had been stung by a bee.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="">"They only sting if you bother them," Harry retorts, apparently still trying to defend the bug.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis huffs. "Excuse me, how is lying down and enjoying the sun bothering them?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looks up at the sky again, snorting. "Okay. Have you ever been stung by a bee?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"As a matter of fact, yes I did. And it hurt like a bitch.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shakes his head, but Louis notices the soft smile on Harry’s lips, and it’s a nice sight.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"So...” he starts, tearing off some grassroots. He isn’t sure he should do that, Alice Styles’ gardening is flawless. "Enjoying summer so far?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry hums, his hand scratching his tummy as his scrunches his nose. He looks like a cat somehow. Louis really doesn't know why this comparison came to his mind.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"And you?" he asks Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah. I’m not looking forward to another year at school though. Thank god it's my last year. Then I'll be free.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry huffs. “Lucky you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I'll miss my friends, though,” Louis confesses. “I know I'll see them still, but at school there's this routine, you know?" Harry hums in agreement, looking back at Louis. "Hanging out with them, joking around when skipping classes... It’s nice, and soon it’ll be over.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry smiles sadly at him. “I know the feeling. That’s why you’ll have to enjoy the upcoming year to its fullest.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods; about to form an answer, when suddenly, his body is doused in cold water, making him squeal as he sits straight up on his towel with a gasp.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Daniel's laughter fill his ears, and Louis glares at his brother, before glancing at Harry and noticing he's as wet as him. His younger brother is holding a bucket in his hand, a wide, proud smile is plastered on his face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's other brother Matthew is also standing there proudly, but with a water gun in his hands. He doesn’t give Harry a moment of respite, shooting the water gun directly into Harry’s face</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The latter puts his hands up to protect himself, groaning. "Stop! Matty!" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Matthew grins devilishly, shaking his head. "Nu-uh, it's my birthday, so I can do whatever I want.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis glances at Harry, and they eyes lock. It’s like they silently have a conversation, because then they both smirk and nod, before getting up swiftly. They have no trouble stealing the water gun, and from then ensues a water fight, lots of laughters, and a <em>lot</em> of water.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="center">
  <strong>
    <span class="s1">**</span>
  </strong>
</p><p class="p2" align="center"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The day passes quite quickly. They eat a gigantic and delicious lunch all cooked by Alice Styles and her kids, especially Harry, who apparently participated a lot. Louis wonders how many things Harry can do, because he seems full of surprises. When Louis tells him so under his breath, Harry gives him a dimpled smile and hides his blush by drinking his drink in one of the fanciest glasses Louis has even seen.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He knows the Styles are wealthy, for sure, and Louis' family isn't that poor, even if they struggled financially in the two last years. Fortunately, Natasha's British family helped a bit ; but his parents' have always found a way to make sure their kids had anything they ever needed or wanted, and for that, Louis is forever grateful for his parents. He loves them. He loves his entire family.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He takes back his words a few seconds later, when his sisters Jeanne and Elizabeth start kicking his legs under the table. Louis figures he can’t very well be mad at them, even though they sometimes are the most annoying people he's ever seen. Plus, he always likes a good fight under the table. So he retaliates.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Unfortunately, his parents know their kids too well, and soon Natasha gives them a long look behind her glasses, silently asking them to behave.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis stops immediately, raising a finger at his sisters at the other side of the table. The girls bite their lips to hold back their smiles.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">During lunch, Louis gets to know more about William. He has a very funny personality, and they exchange jokes during the whole meal, making the younger siblings giggle. Too often, Louis catches Harry choking on his drink, trying in vain to hide the wide smile on his face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But Louis sees it, and he always gets that proud feeling at making Harry's cheeks turn red while the boy bites back his laughter. Louis likes to think Harry laughs the most at <em>his</em> jokes, and not his brother's. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After lunch, the kids go back to the lake, jumping on the trampoline even though Natasha and Alice advised to wait a bit after lunch. But, hey, they're kids, so obviously they don't listen. So it really is no surprise when Nathan Tomlinson ends up throwing by the lake. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis and Harry choose to move to the deck, sitting at a little table with two chairs Alice put there. It’s cosy, and Louis would gladly wake up in the morning, taking his breakfast by this little spot.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He and Harry chat together while sipping their drinks (Louis an orange juice and Harry an apple juice).</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So about tomorrow,” Harry starts excitedly, biting his straw. Louis tries not to stare at that. "I thought about it, and maybe we could go to Wisp Resort? It's not far from here, and we can go on boat. There are a lot of fun activities to do there. What do you think?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods eagerly, already knowing tomorrow will be fun since he gets to spend it with Harry. "Sounds good to me.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It’ll just be me and you, by the way,” Harry informs slowly, his voice sounding shy suddenly. He isn’t looking at Louis, apparently fascinated by his drink. "William is coming of course, but he'll join some friends there,” he says, trying to shrug nonchalantly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Louis and Harry. Just us. Tomorrow.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' body feels like gelatin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He doesn't know why, but he suddenly feels a bit nervous at the prospect of hanging out with Harry only, away from the others. They aren’t those small kids anymore, who used to used to play together by the lake with toys.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They’re all grown up, and it's just a bit weird, but in a good way. They can now be more independent and leave the domain.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis actually cannot wait.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He really does like to spend some time with Harry. He's a great and fun lad, and Louis looks forward to tomorrow.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Louis! Harry!" Daniel shouts, and both boys turn their heads, focusing their attention on the trampoline where Daniel, Jeanne, Elizabeth, Nathan, and Vicky Styles stand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Look, I'm gonna dive," he announces excitedly, the others cheering to encourage him. He dives in the water and comes back later, a huge smile on his face as he looks at his brother Louis for approval.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis gives him a thumb up, smiling broadly at him. "Good job, lad! You are the best.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry raises an invisible paddle, beaming enthusiastically. "I give you ten out of ten.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Daniel raises an arm out the water and cheers as Jeanne whistles at her brother from the trampoline.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looks at Louis with a fond smile. "Yours brothers and sisters are adorable.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles around his straw, eyes closing briefly. "I know,” he says fondly. “But I'm the most adorable in the family.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry snorts, raising an eyebrow as he finishes his drink. "Somehow, I doubt that. You definitely aren't the angel face of this family.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis looks up at Harry, mock-offended. "How dare you, Styles? You don't even know me at all.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Oh, but I do.” Harry’s tone is as teasing and amused as Louis’.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And so they decide to start playing the game of questions, to get to know each other a bit better.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I'll start," Harry announces.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis huffs. "Why you?" He can’t help but being annoying to Harry. But the boy is just entertained, apparently.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Because I came up with the game," he answers casually with a shrug, beaming proudly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"If it makes you happy...” Louis rolls his eyes fondly, but gestures for Harry to ask the first question.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry thinks for a few seconds, propping his elbows on the table, looking at the sky. Louis definitely doesn't take advantage of Harry not looking to admire the boy's lovely face bathed in the sun, eyes so bright it could make Louis blind. He doesn’t.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"If you could live anywhere, where would it be?" Harry settles for, eyes landing on Louis' face, who quickly glances away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Um... I think, Los Angeles.” He answers without hesitation. He doesn't know why, but he likes Los Angeles. He's only been there one time, but he loved it, although he wished he had more time then to visit more.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Me too," Harry says enthusiastically, making Louis smile. They definitely have a lot of things in common. "Your turn," Harry reminds him, nudging his shoulder.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mmh... What is your favorite book to read?" It's a random and simple question, but Harry seems happy to launch into a conversation about his favorite book and why he loves reading it. And the worst thing is that Louis drinks every single word coming out of Harry’s lovely mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">God, he could definitely get lost in Harry's deep, slow voice.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">From this question, they start talking about their passions, and Louis definitely loves it when Harry talks about them, because the light in the boy's eyes when he talks about something he loves is breathtaking, and the way he makes gestures while talking is adorable, although normally Louis would hate it when people move their arms all the time.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But Louis figures he doesn't mind a bit, not when Harry's face is always taken by a massive smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Harry is finished, apparently realizing he got carried away in his explanation (he was talking about some different ways of paint), he blushes and fidgets with his orange bracelet (Louis just noticed it). "I'm sorry, I tend to get carried away on things that I love.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Don't apologize," Louis answers immediately, frowning. "Ever. It's good to see how passionate people are.” He means it. He doesn't know if it's only Harry, but he likes it when the boy speaks about something he likes. He doesn't even matter if Louis isn't interested in the first place, because the excitement in the boys' eyes and his voice, and just how he rumbles… it's quite endearing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis quickly finds Harry to be an enthusiastic person, and he shouldn't be surprised. Harry seems like to be a ball of joy, being in awe about random things. And enthusiasm, to Louis, is an important quality in life.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What's the most daring thing you've ever done?" Harry asks, and Louis starts telling how he once ran around the football field completely naked when some girls were practicing their cheerleading. "On the topic of girls,” Louis continues, smiling at Harry’s laughter, “my friend Stan also dared me to go into the girls' toilets, but it's a classic.” Louis shrugs, unimpressed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry laughs at that. "I'm not even surprised.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah?" Louis smirks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah," Harry confirms with the same constant smile on his face. "You're just seem to be that kind of person,” he waves a hand, “vivid, out-going… Always up for some fun. And you definitely like pranks, for sure.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis raises his hands in the air. "You got me. That’s me, in a nutshell.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s mouth crinkles into another blinding smile, looking pleased with himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What about you, Harold?" Louis asks, curious. Because enough of him, he wants to talk about Harry. "Tell me some embarrassing things about yourself.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well, <em>Lewis</em>...” Harry starts with a smirk. "For starters, my name is not Harold… My mother did name me Harriet.” Louis blinks, falling silent. "It's true," Harry confirms with a nod, expression serious. "My mum didn't realize it was a girl's name, and still insists it's a boy's name. But yeah, officially I'm Harriet Edward Styles.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis bursts into laughter, shaking his head. "You're so silly.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry bates his eyelashes. "What, you don't think Harriet suits me?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' cheeks start hurting because of his huge smile on his face. "Whatever.” He rolls his eyes, smile still present on his face. "Okay, what's your favorite movie?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry purses his lips, thinking about it, and then he pouts at Louis (and Louis tries not to freak out at that. Harry is just adorable, okay?). "I can't tell you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis raises an eyebrow at that, puzzled. "Why not?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's pout deepens. "You’re gonna make fun of me.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry seems apparently very shy to share his favorite movie. So he’s quick to reassure Harry, scolding his face to the most serious expression he is capable of. "I won't,” he says softly. “I promise.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry hesitates for a few more seconds, and Louis gives him a reassuring smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Alright,” the younger boy breathes out, throwing his hands in the air. "In my defense, it's because of my sister, Erica, okay, she always used to watch these movies–"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Harold, Harriet…” Louis tuts, cutting the boy off. "You don't have to justify yourself. I'm serious, you can like whatever you like, to hell with the people mocking you. Fuck them.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry blinks at Louis, but then a faint smile makes its way on his face. "Yeah, you're right.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis grins, satisfied.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well," Harry licks his lips. "I love Titanic, Love Actually, and The Notebook. All the chick flick movies," he finishes with a faux-cheer.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I love all those movies as well," Louis quickly says, and it’s true. "They're great.” And that’s that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry relaxes and gives Louis a smile that is so reassured and sweet, with just the right touch of shyness. Unexpected warmth suddenly rushes through Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"If you wanna know,” he says to Harry. “my favorite series is One Tree Hill, and I'm totally heals over Chad Michael Murray,” Louis confesses shamelessly, quite proudly, and Harry giggles, telling him that he can’t blame him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And so they confess each other's crush. Harry admits he's always had a huge crush on Frankie Sandford from The Saturdays, while Louis in turn proclaims he loves Natalie Portman and Robbie Williams.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis learns that Harry's favorite animals are turtles, but he’s a big fan of cats, and it was even his first word (Louis gasps at that, telling him that his first word was also cats, and it's so strange how similar they are on some points) but he likes dogs too.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He learns that Harry hates it when people bite caps off glass bottles, and also hates when girls swear and smoke, and that he often reprimands his younger sister Vicky when she swears around nine-years-old Tara. He also informs Louis that he can juggle and play kazoo, and that he once had a hamster he named... Hamster. (Honestly what even is this boy, Louis is so fond of him.) Harry tells Louis how he hates snakes, and when he was younger, at the very same lake, while he and his family were hiking, his brother Will found one and thought it would be hilarious to throw a little snake at Harry. So little Harry cried for 2 hours after that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis can't help but laugh at Harry's story, and even the latter laughs about it now, although he admits he still fears those creatures.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Then for some reasons Louis starts talking about that lead role he got in his school's production of "Grease", and Harry finds that amazing. They start talking about movies again, and for some reasons Louis needs to know something very important that he looks for a partner (okay, not really).</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Okay, I don't know about you," Louis starts, stretching his arms as he raises his head to face the sun. "I love superheroes movies, so it's an important question right here.” He looks down at Harry, assessing him with a serious expression.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry bites his lips to hold back his smile, apparently very amused. “Fire away.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"If you were a superhero, what powers would you have?" he asks, full attention on Harry, waiting for his answer.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry thinks about it, because apparently his answer will determine or not if he is worth Louis's friendship. "I think I'd like to have the ability to travel in time.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He assesses Louis' face for a second, and when the latter nods and smiles, Harry knows he's passed the test. "What about you then?" he asks Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Since everyone tells me I'm Peter Pan, and <em>I am</em>, I think I'd like to fly.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary suddenly appears besides them, almost startling Louis. Her hands are perched on her hips, and she’s watching between the pair of them with a knowing smile. Then she smirks down at her brother. "You mean you are Peter Pan because you forever want to be a child and because you are immature.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis gently pushes her hip, huffing. "Sod off.” He notices his sister's drenched outfit, and he raises an eyebrow at her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What do you think happened?" she snorts, raising an eyebrow in turn. She looks at Harry then, pretending to be angry. "Your brother William pushed me in the lake," she groans, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry widens his eyes at the revelation, looking back at Louis with biting lips. He’s apparently trying not to laugh, and so is Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“See, Harold,” Louis whispers conspiratorially. “The oldest are the most immature.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry giggles while Mary hits Louis' shoulder.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Alright you two,” she cuts in. “I came here to tell you that if you want some cakes and cookies, you better hurry up because the little monsters are eating everything.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They don't need to be told twice. They get up from their chairs and make a race towards the house, Louis laughing hard when Harry almost slips on the deck while Mary yells at them to be careful, rolling her eyes fondly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When they arrive at the house, there's only one cookie left (apparently all the kids preferred these to the fancy cakes) and both boys glance at each other before running for it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is the one grabbing it first, and immediately Harry does his act: he pouts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis rolls his eyes fondly, smiling. He splits the cookie in half and hands the other part to Harry. "Sharing is caring.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry answers with a bright smile, and yeah, splitting the cookie in two was definitely worth the sacrifice.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As they eat on the balcony, Alice comes outside and offers each Of Louis’ siblings an ice cream, all the kids politely thanking the woman before going back near the lake.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis and Harry stay a bit behind with the parents, and soon enough they are all cooing and giggling at Erin, who’s testing ice cream for the first time. Louis has almost tears in his eyes as he watches his sister pulling faces.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis notices Harry playing with Erin’s little hands, the toddler babbling to him as Harry listens to her attentively. Louis tries not to dwell too much on it, but Harry's happy face is contagious. Harry is being very cute with Erin, and even the little girl doesn’t seem immune to Harry’s charms - she’s so enamored by him, in fact, that she doesn’t want to leave his lap.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And Louis really has to bite back his fondness when his little sister nuzzles her head into Harry’s neck, Harry beaming at the gesture. They’re honestly too cute, and Louis knows he’s probably hiding his fondness poorly, because when he catches his sister Mary's eye, she’s wearing a sly smile, a knowing gaze directed at him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis obviously ignores it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Later on, Harry and Louis join where the fun party is, on the trampoline with the younger siblings. Louis doesn't even care if he's too old for that. After all, no one is too old to have fun (especially when your father suddenly joins the party at one point).</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It’s no surprise that by the end of the day, they are all exhausted (Louis really doesn't know how the kids spent their afternoon jumping everywhere, he’s knackered). Louis and Harry end up laying on the wet trampoline with Eliza, while everyone else is now onshore, drying themselves with bath towels because the Tomlinsons are leaving soon. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Don't you guys think this cloud looks like a dick?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis gasps at the words coming from his sister's mouth, while Harry chokes on his saliva besides him, laughter breaking the peaceful quiet they were settled in.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Eli!” Louis exclaims in indignation. He glances at his sister on his right, who is gazing up at the sky, not looking at him. Louis sees the smile she's holding back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What, though? It's true,” she retorts with a snort, shrugging her shoulders.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It is,” Harry supplies from Louis' left side, and the latter nudges him, making Harry yelp. "I'm sorry, Lou,” the boy giggles. "We cannot deny the evidence in front of our eyes, you know…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"The only thing I know is that I'm gonna punch you in the face if you don't stop talking,” Louis deadpans, but he smiles at Harry when the boy turns his head to look at him, maybe to see if Louis was joking or not.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When the younger boy sees Louis' face, he smiles in relief, before lifting his eyes on the sky. He points a finger. “This one looks like a smurf.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis stares at the cloud Harry is designating with narrowed eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"How do you see a smurf"? Eliza asks, puzzled. Louis feels the same.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah, to me it looks more like a poop,” Louis snorts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He hears Harry laughs in response besides him. "Yeah, you're right. Poop it is.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It's so stupid, but Louis snorts again. They stay a few more minutes like this, until eventually Warren and William call for them, announcing that Louis' family is leaving.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="center">
  <strong>
    <span class="s1">**</span>
  </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Tomlinsons and Styles say their goodbyes around 6:45pm.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis and Harry stand with awkward smile on their faces, knowing they're going to see each other tomorrow anyway, with Harry's brother William. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I had a fun day,” Harry confesses while Louis' siblings are getting in the car.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Me too,” Louis answers softly, smile on his face. He’s being sincere. He really did have a good time. Harry is a fun guy to hang out with. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Curly.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry beams and nods, waving Louis goodbye. His face is honestly endearing, and Louis’ heart definitely doesn’t melt at that. </span>
</p><p class="p1" align="center">
  <strong>
    <span class="s1">**</span>
  </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Later on in the night, after Louis got into bed, he checks on his laptop the weather for tomorrow. His expression promptly falls when it’s apparently announced cloudy and that it might rain.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>What the hell?</em> It's summer, it isn't supposed to rain! Not when Louis is doing some boating with Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry, and his older brother. Right.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They had a splendid sunny day today, and Louis starts praying all the Gods that tomorrow will be the same.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Why the sad face, bro?" Warren asks as he kisses Daniel goodnight on the forehead.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis sighs, turning off his laptop and putting it on his beside table. "Nothing.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He turns out his light and keeps praying.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis wakes up at 9:28am, feeling in a good enough mood to have a stroll in the woods around his house. He quickly takes a shower and goes down the kitchen, kissing his mother on the cheek when he spots her cleaning Erin's mess after her breakfast.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hello, love,” Natasha greets him with a warm smile, returning the affection with a kiss on the cheek. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Morning, mum,” he replies, automatically taking out a bowl from the cupboards, a box of cereal already on the kitchen table. His mother opens the fridge and puts the milk on the breakfast bar, Louis thanking her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You're up quite early, you know you’re on vacation, right? You can actually sleep in, Boo,” she teases.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis chuckles, bringing his spoon of cereals to his mouth. “Yeah, but I need to go stretch my legs. And I dunno,” he shrugs. “Just wanna enjoy the woods this morning, on my own.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha nods, understanding. "What are you doing today? You're seeing Harry and his brother today, right?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mmh, yeah.” He gulps his cereals down, nodding. "We're actually going to the Wisp Mountain Park.” He looks up from his bowl, slightly frowning at his mother. "You're still okay with it, right? You're not going to spray it on me at the last minute that dad wants to go fishing with me?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His mother laughs and rolls her eyes. “No, you can go. You are free to do whatever you want, your father can handle it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles, satisfied. He loves his father, he really does, but Louis doesn’t count on spending all his days fishing. “We literally have two weeks to do everything dad wants to do. And it'll be the vacation he wanted, I promise.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha smiles sweetly at that, ruffling her son's hair. “So...” she starts, seating on the stool next to him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis slowly lifts his eyes to look at her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Uh oh, he knows that look. It's the same knowing look Mary wears every time she knows something, before Louis even realizes it himself. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"So?" Louis prompts innocently, chewing on his cereals and staring down at his bowl. His Lucky Charms seem very interesting, suddenly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You had fun yesterday at the Styles'?" she asks, her tone as innocent as his.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes…” He looks up at her, squinting. "Did you?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha flicks her hair over her shoulder, humming. “Oh, yes, I did. It was very nice to see Alice after all this time. We did keep contact for a few years, but we hadn't seen each other in a while.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis finishes drinking his milk and hums in response. He almost chokes when his mother speaks again. "I saw you spent all your time with Harry yesterday.” He nervously glances at her. She’s rubbing the palm of her hands over the table, a small smile on her face. Louis swears he sees her eyes twinkle. “He’s a sweet kid.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shrugs, trying to play it cool. He stands up and puts his bowl in the sink. "Yes, he's nice.” He hears his mother hum behind his back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">See, Louis came out to his mother after he started having doubt when he was dating Hannah. Truthfully, Louis accepted to date his old friend when he saw all his other friends of 15 years old started dating girls. So of course, Louis had to date girls too, right? Hannah was nice and his friend. He was young and eager to date someone, so he said yes when she asked him out.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They stayed together for five months before Louis realized that maybe, just maybe, Hannah wasn't quite exactly what he wanted, and that, maybe he liked to look at boys more than he wanted to admit it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis ended things straight away, because he couldn’t see himself pursuing a relationship in which he wasn’t being honest, be it to Hannah or to himself. Thankfully, Hannah took it well. He didn’t plan on telling her he liked boys, but somehow he did, and she was so understanding that Louis had almost wanted to cry. She thanked him for his honesty and she actually found a liking in finding the boys for Louis. It was quite funny.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Four months after he and Hannah broke up, Louis met a boy at a party. His name was Aiden, and Louis… Well, he quickly fell for Aiden. They dated for a few months, and they honestly had a great relationship. They were both experiencing boys for the first time, so it had been a great plus for Louis since he was still discovering himself. But months pass and then Louis wasn’t feeling <em>it</em>. He wasn’t in love. And Aiden felt the same. They mutually put a stop to their relationship. (Louis may or may not have heard that right after they broke up, Aiden found another boy. Well… Good for him.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis hasn’t dated that many boys since. It’s quite hard to find one, especially when you’re still in high school. So usually Louis meets new people during parties, but it never leads to anything serious.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And Louis… Well, he knows he’s young, but he wants something serious. He wants something that makes him think “ooh, so that’s how it feels to be in love?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He just hopes that, one day, he'll find the right person. The person who will make him breathless with each kiss, who will make him happy every single day, a person who is everything to him, a person he truly feels connected with. He knows he'll find it someday. He hopes he will.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis sighs, shaking his head to himself. He almost got lost in his thoughts, there. He washes his hand before turning around to face his mother. “Anyways, I’m gonna grab some stuff and go have a walk in the woods.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha looks at him a few seconds in silence, before nodding. She cups his chin in her hand and kisses him on the forehead. That’s her way of telling him ‘if you need to talk, I’m here’.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Alright honey, be careful.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I will!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He quickly goes upstairs and hears the laughter before he enters his shared room. He smiles to himself and opens the door, finding his brother Daniel carefully bouncing on Warren's back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Come on, wake up, War,” Daniel giggles, passing his hands through his brother's hair. Louis winces for Warren. The latter lets out a groan, which only makes Daniel grin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Careful there,” Louis warns Daniel, grabbing his bag off the floor and checking that his notepad is in it. He unplugs his phone from the bedside table and puts it inside his pants pocket.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Where are you going?" Dan asks inquisitively. He falls on the bed next to Warren, sliced eyes fixed on Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m taking a stroll, and no, you're not coming,” Louis quickly rushes to say, making Daniel pout in response. “Go have some breakfast and keep it down, some people are actually still sleeping.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Daniel grins again and brings his hand to his forehead. "Aye, chief.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis rolls his eyes fondly and exits the room, closing the door as Dan yells at Warren to stop tickling him.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="center">
  <strong>
    <span class="s1">**</span>
  </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis ends up leaving the house at only 11am because the twins, Nathan and Elizabeth — plus little Ren — thought it was a good idea to have a fruit battle during breakfast. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Louis saw how distressed his mother looked, trying to calm everyone down while trying to soothe Erin, who had knocked her head against the table, Louis came to his mother’s rescue and cleaned the whole mess. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A few minutes later, Natasha has finally got Erin to calm down. She informs Louis she’s gonna bathe the baby. Before she leaves though, she orders Louis to stop looking after the kids and threatens him to kick him outside. “Go have your promenade, sweetie!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Thankfully, Mary arrives and takes over, kissing Louis on the head and telling him to listen to their mom and go. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis doesn't really mind taking care of his family. He's used to it, since he's one of the oldest. So he knows an accident — albeit generally minor — can occur at any moment within the Tomlinsons household. You <em>always</em> have to be prepared. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That doesn't mean Louis hadn't thrown some fit from time to time, especially when he was around 14-15 years old, when he started being a bit rebellious, claiming that he wasn't ‘the father of this family and that he needed a life too’.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He also went as far to say that his parents ‘abused his generosity’. The way he said it may have been a bit more rude and harsh than intended, and Louis got grounded for a week and half, but his parents conceded he was right on some points. Since then, they all try to make it work.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But having a big family means that sometimes others could take over, and Louis was so grateful for that. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Louis sets a foot outside, he frowns at the cloudy sky, pursing his lips while still sending prayers for the day to get brighter. He really is looking forward to go boating and spend a day on his own with Harry… Erm, Harry<em> and </em>his brother. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He shakes his head and brings his headphones to his ears. Immediately, Coldplay's song <em>Viva La Vida</em> starts playing. Louis grins to himself and thinks of Harry as he starts trotting in a slow pace. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He’s been jogging for twenty minutes when he spots a familiar mop of curls hair running in the opposite direction. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis instantly beams, and not because of the sight of Harry, but because the boy’s hair is drawn back by a pink headband. He looks ridiculously adorable with his flashing red trousers and white shirt. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry spots him and immediately smiles, stopping just in front of Louis, who has also stopped jogging. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hi you,” Louis says through his pants. He consciously rubs his forehead with the back of his hand. He hopes he isn’t sweating too much. “I didn't know you jogged.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry huffs a laugh, shaking his head. “I don’t, not really. William forced me to join him.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods with an understanding smile. "I see. I sometimes drag Mary out. We like to compete.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry rubs a little of sweat from his glistening forehead. “I hate running,” he complains, scrunching his nose. It’s cute. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes, lifting his head towards the sky. Louis certainly doesn't stare at his Adam apple when Harry swallows. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, apparently it's going to rain this afternoon,” Harry says, dropping his head to look at Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In turn, Louis inspects the sky, which had certainly gotten darker than compared to earlier. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It's weird how a day can make a difference,” he says to Harry with a frown. "Yesterday it was very sunny, and now—”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“—I know,” Harry pouts. “Will and I actually thought… Maybe we should postpone our plans for tomorrow?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods reluctantly, trying to mask his deception as he answers, "Yeah...”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He is a bit disappointed, but he also doesn't think doing activities outside with this weather would be pleasant, especially if he wants to have a fun day with Harry... And his brother. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Speaking of his brother, William jogs towards them, looking extremely sweaty in his training outfit.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hello, Louis Tomlinson,” Will acknowledges him with a dimpled smile. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey,” Louis smiles, waving his hand. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry turns towards his brother. "I was just telling Louis we should move our plans to tomorrow.” He raises a finger at the sky and purses his lips. "Not gonna be good if it rains.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Will rubs his forehead with the back of his hand and sighs heavily. "Yeah, mum texted me we should get home soon if we don't wanna get soaked.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry nods and wavers his hand at brother. “Go ahead, I'll catch up with you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Will nods and claps Louis on the shoulder as a goodbye before running away. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry ends up staying with Louis for a few minutes as he walks Louis to his home, since the Tomlinson house is the closest. They’re chatting about what they plan to do today, since their today plan just fell into the weather (pun intended), when suddenly Louis feels a drop of water on his face. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He brings his finger to his nose, wiping it away as Harry blinks at him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Oh no,” Louis simply says, and a few seconds later, more drops fall on them.  “Shit, okay let's go,” Louis yells through his laughter, Harry joining him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis doesn't even think twice before grabbing Harry’s hand, and they run to Louis’ house as rain falls heavily, drenching them in a matter of seconds. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They arrive at Louis' house five minutes later, and as soon they're on the porch, Natasha opens the door. She looks them up and down before she yells at Elizabeth to bring towels.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They’re urged inside, taking their shoes off. A few minutes later, and Louis and Harry are wrapped up in towels, the warmth more than welcomed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry salutes, rather timidly, everyone present in the living room, and promptly excuses himself to Natasha for, Louis quotes, “intruding into their house.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha rolls her eyes, gently patting Harry’s cheek. “It's no problem honey. You should text your mother to let her know you're here.” She glances outside the window. “And I don’t know when the rain will stop, so you’re welcome to stay here in the meantime.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry nods and thanks her for the hospitality, which only makes Natasha smile more at Harry. "You're too polite, it's nothing.” She then looks at Louis. "You should lend him some of your clothes, Boo Bear.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' cheeks feel hot as Mary bursts into laughter on the couch, followed by Erin who probably laughs only to imitate her, not really knowing what’s funny. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Not that any of that is funny, Louis thinks as he internally groans. His mother always calls him Boo Bear in front of his friends, but really, did she have to say that in front of Harry?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis doesn't spare a glance for his sister as he nudges Harry and tells him to follow him, avoiding Harry’s eyes. Despite himself, he still catches Harry’s amused smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis only blushes harder. </span>
</p><p class="p1" align="center">
  <strong>
    <span class="s1">**</span>
  </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis happens to have left some spare clothes in his drawers that fit Harry, and while Harry goes to change in the bathroom, Louis quickly changes himself, ignoring his brother's gaze on his back. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Weren't you supposed to go out or something?" Warren says. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis turns to him and gives him a look, his head halfway through the hole of the shirt. “Have you actually left your freaking bed today? Can’t you see it's raining outside?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Warren gives him an unimpressed look and shrugs his shoulders, turning his attention to his laptop on his lap. "You can do plenty of stuff outside, even when it's raining. Me and dad are going on an adventure after lunch.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Good for you,” Louis huffs, slipping on some trousers. “I’m definitely staying in.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Harry exists the bathroom, Louis has two seconds of staring at him. It’s weird to see Harry in his old clothes. He’s wearing a Green Day shirt, which Louis thought he had lost, and some gray trousers.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As Louis finds Harry some slippers, Natasha knocks at the door. She pokes her head, smiling at Harry. “Harry, darling, do you like avocado?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry blinks at her, before bashfully nodding. “Yes, I do. Thank you again, Mrs. Tomlinson, for having me over.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha waves it off with a soft smile. “Don't mention it. Lunch will be ready at 1-ish, depends on how fast my girl works.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis snorts at that, crossing his arms over his chest. “Who's helping?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Because if it's Eliza, it's going to take a while. She doesn't like to cook. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Eliza,” his mother replies, giving him a meaningful look, having caught his implication.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Oh well.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="center">
  <strong>
    <span class="s1">** </span>
  </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shouldn’t probably have talked so fast, because Eliza actually surpassed herself today. (At least that's what Natasha said as they all take place around the table, minus Erin, who ate earlier and is now snoozing in her room.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry sits between Louis and Mary. The table is full of empty plates, waiting to be filled with salads and bacon avocado fries.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"So, Harry,” Tristen suddenly starts, and Louis looks around the table, feeling the situation a bit funny. It's like he is introducing his boyfriend to his whole family, and his father is about to interrogate him. The funny part is obviously that Harry is <em>not </em>Louis’ boyfriend. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's head snaps up at his name, and he looks at Tristen with wide eyes. It almost makes Louis want to laugh.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Where are you boys going tomorrow?” Tristen asks, serving himself some salad. “Is it really better than the family plans I had?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis, who was playing with his fork while waiting to be served, almost drops it. He gives his father an alarmed look as Natasha elbows her husband. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looks automatically guilty, eyes widening even more at that. “Oh! I—I didn't know Louis had other obligations.” He turns to Louis with a regretful expression. "We can do that another day if you want… I don't mind.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>I do</em>, Louis bites back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">God, Harry is too pure for this world.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He smiles reassuringly at Harry and shakes his head. "Don't worry, Harry. My father is only joking.” He pronounces that bit while looking pointedly at his father. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His dad was indeed joking, but Harry doesn't know his humor like Louis does. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen laughs as he wipes his mouth with his napkin. “Yes, I was! Don’t worry, Harry, you both are free to do whatever you want tomorrow!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry visibly relaxes and Mary makes a show to sympathetically pat him on the shoulder while Warren assures his father that ‘yes, I’m still up for our adventure today’.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The rest of the meal goes without incident, for once, and when the younger kids leave the table, Harry politely proposes to help cleaning the dishes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha shakes her head, looking appalled at the mere prospect of it. “No way. You’re the guest. Mary and I will take care of it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis really appreciates Harry's politeness and kindness. He’s too cute.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They decide to join the others in the living room. The weather outside is still mediocre, rain pouring down hard. Elizabeth proposes watching a Disney movie on the flat screen, which is of course welcomed with cheers by everyone. For a moment, Louis is scared of Harry’s reaction, but the boy only seems eager at the prospect of watching a Disney movie. That’s a point for him, Louis thinks. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He plops down on the comfortable couch, waving at Harry. "Make yourself at home.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry grins and sits next to Louis while Ella, Jeanne, and Elizabeth argue over which movie to watch. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry,” Jeanne calls, interrupting her sisters with a hand, who both immediately stop talking.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is sometimes amazed how authoritative her little sister can be, and that's probably why her two sisters look up to her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Jeanne perches her hand on her hips, brown eyes fixed on Harry inquisitively. "Which movie should we watch first, according to you?" She holds out every DVDs as she names them. “We’ve got ‘Wall-E’, ‘Tinker Bell’, or ‘The Little Mermaid III,’, which is Ariel’s beginning?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ella huffs. “Why can Harry decide and not m—” she starts to say, but Jeanne waves a hand at her, hushing her. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Because Harry is the guest, and the guest should have the final word.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The pressure is on,” Louis mutters to Harry, who looks between him and the girls with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ella huffs at her sister, murmuring under her breath that she is ‘14 years old, thank you very much, I'm older than you’. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry thinks thoughtfully for a few seconds, bringing a finger to his chin while looking up at the ceiling. Louis can't help but laugh, especially because Jeanne is genuinely waiting for him to decide, as if his choice will save or end the world. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Finally, Harry gives his answer. “Well, I’ve never watched the third movie of The Little Mermaid, so it’s pretty much a crime, right? We need to resolve that.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Elizabeth and Ella cheer at that, but Jeanne's expression falls. Visibly, it wasn’t the answer she was waiting for. “Fine,” she huffs. She gives Ella the DVD so that her sister can put it on, and then she sits on the couch, pointing a finger at Harry. "You're on my bad side for now, Harry Styles.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry bites his lip, holding back a smile while Louis bursts into laughter, shaking his head at his sister. She’s a menace. They all are.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They watch the movie in silence, and they’re even joined by the boys within the first five minutes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At some point, Elizabeth crawls between Louis and Harry on the couch, and Louis lets her, wrapping an arm around her. A few seconds later only, and she turns her attention to Harry, whispering, “Would you mind braiding my hair please, Harry?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looks at Louis for his approval, and when Louis nods with a smile, Harry beams and nods at Elizabeth, who promptly sits between his legs as if she has been prepared for this moment his whole life. Louis finds it cute.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Once Harry prettily braids Eli's hair, Ella and Jeanne asks him for some braids too. Louis almost reprimands his sisters for taking advantage of Harry’s generosity and patience, but Harry assures him he doesn’t mind. And so he braids Louis’ sisters, and once he’s finished with Jeanne, she turns to him and kisses him on the cheek. "You are now on my good side.” And then she goes back to her seat without another word. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis bites his lips, trying to hold back a smile, but when Harry looks at him happily, Louis can no longer hold it back.  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Toward the end of the movie, Eliza joins them, quickly followed by Mary. They put on another movie, this time Wall-E, at Jeanne and Nathan's pleasure. They watch it in silence, all settled on the couches.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When the movie ends, Natasha informs them all that a chocolate cake is awaiting them, and the kids all run to the dining room, taking seats around the table. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis stays behind with Harry before joining the chaotic room. "Hey, thanks for being patient with them. I know they're quite a lot to handle, and they can be annoying sometimes.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry grins at him, shaking his head. “No worries. And I’m used to it. I adore kids anyways, they could never bother me.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles at that as they finally go join the others. They eat the delicious cake Mary and Natasha made, and when Harry compliments them, Natasha slightly blushes and Mary beams.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis knows Harry has them in his pocket already, with his politeness and his kindness and his charming personality… And his wonderful curls.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis will never stand a chance.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="center">
  <strong>
    <span class="s1">** </span>
  </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After filling their tummies, Jeanne asks Natasha if they are still doing their sacred night. When she gets a positive answer, she excitedly goes to her room with her sisters, planning the night.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What does a sacred night consist of in the Tomlinson household?" Harry asks curiously as he and Louis make their way to Louis’ (and Warren and Daniel’s) room.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Oh, every Sunday, after dinner, it's family time,” Louis answers, grabbing Harry by the elbow when he almost stumbles in the stairs. The curly haired boy blushes and Louis chuckles slightly. “Basically, we just play board games and simply relax.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis opens the door and internally lets out a sigh of relief when he sees that Dan isn't there. It’ll just be Harry and him, then. Warren is still out with Tristen.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Sounds fun,” Harry says, sounding genuinely thrilled.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis gestures for him to make himself home, and Harry sits on Louis' bed while Louis sits on Dan's. "You don't play board games with your family?" Louis asks, arching an eyebrow. It’s such a tradition that Louis forgets that not every family does this kind of things.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"We do, sometimes,” Harry replies, shrugging. "But I'm sure it's not as entertaining as with you guys.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis snaps his fingers. "That you are right, my friend.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They spend the rest of the day discussing their respective families. Harry tells Louis that, while he and his family don’t always do board games, Harry makes sure to share something with all his siblings. For instance, Louis learns that Harry goes jogging with William from time to time and they play guitar together. Louis also learns that Harry often bakes with his sister Vicky, and plays soccer with Matthew, even though Harry sucks at it. And Harry always makes sure he has time to play dolls with his little sister Tara. Louis finds all these anecdotes amazing and adorable.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">However, times go quickly, and soon enough Natasha informs them that the rain has finally stopped, and that Harry should go home before it gets dark.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry thanks her again for everything, and Louis walks Harry to the door in silence. The kids are being loud in the kitchen, probably helping Natasha for the dinner tonight. Louis can’t help but smile when he hears Eliza sing the newest song from The Black Eyed Peas, <em>I Gotta Feeling</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well...” Harry smiles at Louis, hand on the doorknob. “I'll see you tomorrow?” he asks, tone hopeful, as if he feared Louis had changed his mind somehow. If anything, it’s Harry who could have changed his mind, after spending too much time with Louis and his family.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Definitely,” he says to Harry with a nod, grinning.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry returns the grin more bashfully, and nods in turn. There’s a dimple in his cheek. Louis loves it when it makes an appearance. “Bye then,” Harry whispers softly. “See you tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah,” Louis breathes out, and he doesn’t know why. He tries to contain his smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, Harry,” Natasha calls out, exiting the kitchen with something in his hand. “Take this, just in case.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It’s an old green umbrella that Louis has seen too many times in his life, but Harry gratefully takes it, beaming at Louis' mother. "Thank you, Mrs Tomlinson.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Please, Harry,” Natasha tuts, rolling her eyes fondly. "For the hundredth time, call me Natasha. You can even call me Nat.” Louis hides a smile behind his hand. Harry <em>definitely</em> has his mother in his pocket. She pats the boy's shoulder with a motherly smile. "Walk home safe.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry nods solemnly and glances at Louis one last time with a radiant smile before leaving.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Once he's gone, Natasha turns towards Louis with a big smile. "He's lovely,” is all she says, but Louis knows she approves… Whatever she approves.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis snorts and hides his fond smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He certainly agrees with her.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="center">
  <strong>
    <span class="s1">**</span>
  </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After a sumptuous (Ren’s new word for the day) dinner, as planned, Louis has to play board games with his family.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Everyone has to participate, even Tristen, although he and Warren manage to stall by taking a shower after their day outside. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When everyone is settled in the living room, Louis can’t help but notice someone is missing. “Where’s Mary?" He asks, because he doesn't remember her leaving the house.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha settles on the couch with a heavy sigh. She finally managed to get Erin to bed, after a few minutes of struggle. “Oh, she went to town with Harry's sister Erica and some of her friends.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Boys?” Tristen inquires, a scowl on his face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis huffs, amused. "Yes, with some boys.” Natasha answers her husband, rolling her eyes. She pats her husband's knee with a false pout on her face. "Your daughter is 22, darling. She can hang out with boys.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"And I can't?" Eliza cuts in, narrowing her eyes at her parents.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen lets out a frustrated sound. “Young Lady, do I need to remind you of that time I stumbled upon you at the library—”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“—You mean,” Ella cuts him off with a snort, which Louis is impressed by… He would have never dared to interrupt his father at age 14. “When you went to the library — where you usually never go, may I add — just because I was <em>studying</em> there with a boy for a school project? And mum made the mistake of telling you?” She glares at her mother, who gives an apologetic smile. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis remembers the first time his father knew about his first boyfriend. Poor Aiden had to endure his father’s merciless interrogation. Tristen had said to Louis that he approved of Aiden, but he still would keep an eye on them. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After that, Louis made a promise to himself: he will never introduce his next boyfriend to his parents, not until things get serious between them. Also, Louis doesn't particularly want his boyfriend to run away when he meets his family… Especially when you have a family like Louis’. Like Louis said to Harry earlier… They’re a lot to handle.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Because that’s the truth; people tend to get overwhelmed with so many other kids, and Louis will never forget the face of one of his dates when Louis told him for that he has ten brothers and sisters. The guy flew as fast as he could. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Alright,” Jeanne interrupts the argument, opening one game box. “Can we please start our game now?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The whole family ends up playing two parties of the 'Incan Gold', because that's the only game that requires lots of players, but when they’re doing round two, they exchange roles and Louis takes advantage of the situation to say he’s not playing this round. Jeanne groans at that but lets him be. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His phone suddenly vibrates in his pocket, and he can't hold back his smile when he sees 'Harry S' written on his screen.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>From: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>So… Who’s winning? ;) </b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>To: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>I am ofc</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(It's a lie - Louis didn’t win the first round, but Harry doesn't need to know that.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>From: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Of course!! </b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Still ok for tomorrow? Will and I will be at yours around 11am? Is that ok?</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>To: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Yea thats totally fine :) </b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And from that short casual little conversation, they start talking about Harry's evening, where Louis learns that Harry's siblings seem to be some good pranksters too, because while Harry was away, his 12-year-old sister Vicky and 11-year-old brother Matthew thought it was a good idea to juice an onion and put the juice into his body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>From: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>I surely don't smell very pleasant, let me tell you.. </b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis laughs stupidly, bringing his hand to his mouth to stifle his grin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Louis," Eliza calls out, startling Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He lifts his eyes from his screen, attention on his sister. "Yeah?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She sighs, and apparently she called him several times and he didn't hear. "Are you up for 'Labyrinth'?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Sure, bring it on,” Louis immediately answers, promptly focusing his attention on his phone once more while Eliza prepares the game. While he types a reply to Harry, his parents announce they’ll stop playing, as well as Ella, Elizabeth, Daniel, Nathan and Ren, who are all go to sleep. It leaves only Warren, Louis, Eliza, and Jeanne playing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis discovers that he is pretty good at multitasking, because he ends up doing well throughout the game while still being able to text Harry at the same time. However, as they’re ten minutes into the game, Louis sadly realizes he is starting to lose, not having many cards left in his hands compared to his siblings.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Louis, if you're not really playing, you can leave and text elsewhere,” Jeanne snaps with a groan as Eliza slides a tile and makes her path into the game, preventing Jeanne for reaching her object she was coveting.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah, I'm out,” he announces. "Warren takes my card!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"That's not fair, he's gonna win,” Eliza complains, but Louis doesn't hear the end of the new argument because he runs upstairs to brush his teeth, slips his pajama on, and slides into bed, making sure to not disturb Daniel, who's already fast asleep.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry is still sending texts to Louis about random questions, like, <em>"What do we call earthquakes on other planets? Quakes? Shakes?" </em>and from that they launch themselves into a weird conversation about aliens. Louis barely registers when his brother goes to bed a few minutes later. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They must be texting for ages, because it's only when Louis hears noises outside the corridor that he realizes his sister Mary must be home. He checks the time and notices it's 2am.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry has stopped answering him, which is rude because they were discussing ‘Friends’, and Louis sends one last text before getting up to go to pee.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>To: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Have you fallen asleep on me ? Rude !!</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis goes to the nearest bathroom from his floor, but the door won’t budge when he tries to open it. He raises an eyebrow, guessing that Mary must be changing into her pajama or something, and he is about to go to another bathroom when the door opens. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis gasps as silently as he can manage when he takes a look at his sister. She has a nose ring. "Oh my god,” he breathes out, stifling the giggle behind his hands.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary scrunches her nose and moves asides to let him in, closing the door behind him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What the hell?" he asks, turning to face her as more giggles escape his mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I–" She licks her lips, looking both shocked herself and defeated. "I got a bit drunk, okay?” she explains, her words formed with care through the slur in her voice.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis can actually smell the alcohol, and he grimaces at that. "A bit?" he asks dubiously. “I hope you didn’t drive home.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course not,” Mary huffs a laugh, checking her nose again in the bathroom mirror. “Vicky dropped me off. She was sober.” She tentatively touches her nose ring.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He can’t help but laugh again at the distress on her face. “Mum’s gonna proper kill ya.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary groans, at least Louis thinks it's a groan, and she rubs her forehead. "I knooooow,” she laments, rather loudly, and Louis hushes her. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His parents were never really strict… They don't really care what the kids decide to do with their bodies... But… They care a little bit.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha is against tattoos, and while Tristen doesn't really mind them, he doesn't see the point in them. Louis himself doesn't really like tattoos. If he’s being honest, he is a bit scared of getting one, especially when he sees couples getting matching tattoos... The idea of complementary tattoos is a bit scary to him. Piercings though? Louis isn’t even sure he knows his parent’s opinion on them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It looks okay,” Louis admits with a shrug, finally washing his hands. Mary got the stud with an L-bar enclosure, and the jewelry is simple, just a shining gray thing. It’s not that bad.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“‘M’not sure mum’s gonna say the same,” Mary mumbles in thanks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You're on your own with this,” Louis declares, cocking an eyebrow. He then promptly leaves the bathroom, but not before throwing her a devilish smile, making her groan in response. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She’s so fucked.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis had fallen asleep as soon as he hit his mattress last night, and he’s taken aback when he wakes up to a message from Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>From: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Sorry :( I hope you aren't too mad. I'll make it up to you.</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He blinks at his screen, still asleep and disoriented. He then frowns at this phone, rereading the text a second time, before he remembers what the conversation was about.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>To: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Just make sure to pick me up in time, it'll do !</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>From: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Deal.. :) See you later! .H</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis snorts at the signature, biting back the comment ‘I know who you are, silly’, instead deciding to leave it at that. He gets up from his bed, goes to take a quick shower, and dresses lightly for the day.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Before going downstairs, he makes sure to check that the weather is good one last time. Thankfully, outside there’s a beautiful blue sky, free of clouds, and the sunshine is back again.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis really cannot wait to spend the day in the nature with someone like Harry, someone he genuinely enjoys spending time with. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">One look at his phone tells him it's 9:57am, and he's got one hour to have a peaceful breakfast (as peaceful as it is when you have Louis' family) before waiting for Harry and William on the deck.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When he arrives in the kitchen, he's welcomed by the scent of pancakes, and he smiles delightfully, kissing his mother on the cheek. “You're the best!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha's lips lift upward as she finishes the last pancake, adding it to the overflowing plate next to her. Naturally, Louis takes this one, placing his pancake on another plate he takes from the cupboard. He sits at the dining table and contemplates what to put on his pancakes, opting for buttermilk. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Pancakes are ready, kids!" Natasha calls out from the kitchen, and soon enough Louis isn't alone at the table, as all the kids, minus Mary (Louis is actually surprised everyone is up) take their seats.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha passes the pancakes to everyone, and they all chat rather quietly, discussing their plans for today.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Apparently, Warren is taking Daniel and Nathan go-cart racing at Deep Creek Lake, while Tristen is taking Ren on a biking session. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I'd like to go golfing, someone wanna join me?" Eliza asks around a mouthful of pancake.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Golfing?" Nathan snorts. "How old are you?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At the mention of golf, Louis thinks of Harry. The younger boy had confessed to him the other day that golfing was one of his favorite hobbies, and that he plays a lot with one of his best friends back home. Harry is pretty strange, but Louis finds it endearing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Older than you, that's for sure,” Eliza replies with a roll of her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis checks his phone, and even though he's got some time, he contemplates running upstairs to grab his things and prepare himself for the day ahead.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Where's Mary?" Tristen asks his wife.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Still sleeping.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Why is Mary allowed to go out at night, and I can't?" Eliza complains in a huff, tearing off another chunk of pancake with her fingers. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Because she's old enough, and use your cutlery, please,” Natasha reprimands, scowling at her daughter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis wishes he could be there to witness his parents finding out about Mary's piercing — unfortunately, he has other plans, and he shovels down the last of his breakfast, eager to get out of the house. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Can I go? I have to get prepared,” he asks, looking at his parents while wiping his mouth with a napkin. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Sure, honey,” Natasha replies, wiping off Erin's chocolate-covered lips.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Where are you going, Lou?" Tristen interrogates. "Don't you wanna go biking with us?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shakes his head, giving his father a regretful smile. "Maybe next time! Bye everyone!" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And he swiftly leaves the room before his father's pout gets to him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He thinks he hears Tristen claim his son doesn't ‘love him anymore’, and Louis rolls his eyes, hurrying up the stairs.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Louis arrives on the pier, William is just docking, sending a little wave as the boat stabilizes on the surface. He immediately climbs on board, shaking William's hand in greeting. However, Harry surprises him by hugging him. Louis is taken aback, but that doesn't me he doesn't return the hug. When they pull back, Harry is grinning happily at him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Ready for today?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis returns the grin as he puts his bag down, settling in. "You have no idea.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The journey to Wisp Resort is short and quick, and when they arrive, Louis finds himself astonished by the beautiful mountains of Western Maryland. He's actually never been there, or if he has, he can't remember. The place is majestic, with rolling hills of a beautiful green — a perfect contrast, yet complimentary, of the blue sky above. Louis is very pleased.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Today is gonna be a great summer day.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry informs Louis that the resort is amazing during winter, that he and his family even went skiing in 2007, and, according to him still, it’s also the best place during this season because Wisp has one of the most advanced and powerful snowmaking systems in the world.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">William nods at Harry's words, whispering to Louis in conspiracy that Harry is shit at snowboarding and skiing. The curly haired boy hits his brother’s shoulder with a ‘heeeey’, putting on a pout. Louis is so endeared, but no one has to know that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So what should we do first, guys?” William asks, checking his watch on his wrist. "My mates won't be there until 1pm, so unfortunately you'll have to bear with me in the meantime.” He throws an apologetic look at Louis before smirking at his brother. Typical sibling behavior. Angel face around your friends, but devilish side fully activated around your siblings. Louis knows the tempo.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I was thinking," Harry starts proposing. "Maybe we should start with some aerial adventures while it's not too hot?" He looks at Louis for approval before continuing. "And maybe then we'll do water activities when it gets hotter.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods, perching his hands on his hips as he glances at Will for confirmation. "Yeah, sounds good to me.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry beams at his approved suggestion, clapping cheerfully. He looks like a kid who got accorded something big, and it makes Louis smile a lot more than he thought it would.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">”Then let the fun begin!" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Wisp Mountain Park offers three canopy tour challenge adventures — according to your age and weight — and the boys go on the one named "Spider Monkey Adventure”, that apparently promises to offer amazing tree-top views. Louis makes sure he has his camera in his shorts pocket, because he will definitely want to take some pictures from up there. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The trip costs $19, but when Louis draws out his wallet to pay, William bats his hand away, tutting.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' eyes widen at William’s gesture. “Oh! I can’t.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">William smiles and tuts again, paying for Louis before he can object more. “Yeah, you can.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’ll pay you back, at least!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">William shakes his head, and Louis notices for the first time a similar dimple. Seems like it runs in the Styles family. "Honestly, Louis, I can pay for you two, it’s really nothing.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis bites his lip, arguing a few more with burning cheeks, but William won't give in. Eventually Louis drops it, thanking Will profusely at least a dozen of times, making the older boy shake his head. “It's no problem, Tomlinson, really.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">While the trained guide outfits Louis in all the proper gear and shows him the ropes and everything, Louis allows himself to cast a glance at Harry, who seems having a hard time containing his excitement, bouncing a little on the spot, clearly eager to start the experience.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He’s got a tight helmet on his head, his chubby cheeks definitely less compressed than the previous one he had tried on earlier. His eyes are wide open in utter excitement, and Louis has to bite back a laugh when William reminds his brother that he's not some sort of eager kid that can barely contain it. It only makes Harry smile even more, claiming he feels like a kid on Christmas. William only rolls his eyes at his sibling, fondness apparent on his face. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Once they are all suited up in a harness, they finally begin the adventure, climbing the steps to Platform One.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The first obstacle of the parkour is to cross a swinging bridge, which then leads to the Spider's Web. The three of them starts crossing the bridge, stepping on each foot-board carefully. Louis makes sure to hold on tight on the two ropes on each side of the bridge. He also tries not to look what's under him, and instead focuses on walking and breathing, eyes fixed on what's ahead of him. He can feel Harry’s presence behind him, while William is leading. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They almost reach their destination without incident when Harry lets out a squeal behind Louis. Automatically, Louis’ first instinct is to hold on tighter on the ropes, but he almost loses all of reflexes because suddenly there are two massive hands grabbing his hips.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis waits a few seconds until the bridge stills before looking over his shoulder. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looks up, eyes wide. “Yeah,” he breathes out. He’s sweating, and maybe he wasn’t doing so well.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis frowns thoughtfully, a bit worried. “You can hold on to me while we reach the end of the bridge, if you want. We’re almost there.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, Haz,” William calls out, standing on the platform, free from the motion of the bridge. “You’re almost there, come on!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry inhales deeply, and they both stay in suspension for a few more seconds, Louis allowing Harry some time to compose himself. (He’s very thankful that there is no one behind them at the moment.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry takes another long breath, before he nods decisively. “Okay, I’m good.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis flashes him a reassuring smile — at least, he hopes it’s comforting. But Harry returns it, and it seems genuine, not forced or due to nervousness.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Despite the sudden scare Harry’s experienced, Louis can’t help but being mesmerized by the beauty of Harry. He’s standing in the air, in the wild nature, some of curls plastered against his forehead. The forest around them is so dull compared to the vibrant green in Harry’s eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And, erm… Okay, Louis needs to get his act together.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They resume their voyage, reaching the Spider's Web unharmed. It’s called the Spider’s Web because it is basically a web of ropes that they have to get through. They manage to do that brilliantly, but when they get out of the web, there’s another bridge.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis turns to Harry, who registers the obstacle and pouts. Louis can’t help but giggle at his reaction, rubbing his sweaty forehead while Harry gives him a fake dark look.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Smile, Haz,” William tells him, squeezing his brother’s shoulder. “And admire the view.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">William Styles is right, because the landscape in front of them is breathtaking. Deep Creek Lake spreads far and wide before them, not quite blue but more a dull greyish blue, reflecting the sun. It must be around 12:15pm now, and the sunlight feels good on the skin. He feels hot under all their efforts, and he can't wait to get down and drink some water. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Which reminds him of something… He completely forgot to pack a water bottle. How could he be so stupid?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey,” he starts saying to Harry and Will.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry turns to him, humming in response with a contact smile on his face. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Um, do you think we can stop by the shops after that?” He glances at Will briefly. “I completely forgot to bring my water bottle.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Not very convenient,” Harry remarks with a small smirk, and Louis huffs in response, nudging the boy’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course, Louis,” Will reassures Louis. “But first, maybe we should get moving. I don’t fancy getting stuck up there for the rest of the day.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Good idea,” Harry approves, nodding wholeheartedly. Apparently, he’s looking forward to the prospect of touching the ground again.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But before that, they must finish the parkour.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The second bridge is smaller than the first one, and Harry doesn’t struggle as much. (Louis made sure to get behind him, just in case.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The next obstacle they have to face is the "Silver Surfer", which is a snowboard that glides across two ropes to deliver the participant to the other side. It’s a lot of fun, and they quickly make it to the other side.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Finally, they zip over 200 feet back to the starting platform, and it's already the end of their adventure. And by the end of it, they're completely out of breath, sweating like crazy, and thirsty as ever.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But it was fun. Very, very fun. (Especially when Harry had a sudden breakdown on the last bridge, laughing hysterically at nothing. And Louis couldn't help but join, and Will watched the two of them with a concerned but amused expression.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Once they're free of their equipment, they make their way towards the shops, and they take advantage of that to find a good place to eat.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They go to DC's, where there's a daily special for $9,99 and happy hour offer. They get the daily special called "Mustache Monday", which is a sandwich with fresh cut fries. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mmh, the fries are delicious,” Louis almost moans. All these efforts made him starved, and the food is more than welcomed into his body.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mm-mmh,” Harry hums in answer, a dimple poking out. That’s when Louis notices the mustard smeared on his cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Will notices it too, and he throws Louis an amused look, hiding his smirk behind his hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Will's phone buzzes, making him stop in his meal to answer his text. Louis takes the opportunity to signal Harry that he should, just maybe, wipe his cheeks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry frowns at him, but obeys. When he takes a look at his napkin, his mouth hangs open as if this is the worst and unacceptable thing that could have ever happened to him. Louis almost chokes on his coke because Harry’s scandalized expression is too funny.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Instead he munches his sandwich, averting his gaze to Will. "Your friends are arriving any time soon?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Will looks up from his phone and put it down on the table sending a reply. "In one hour approximately, but it all depends on the traffic. Even though they told me it was going alright so far.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After they pay each part of their meal, Louis insisting on paying their desserts, which William reluctantly lets him, they make a quick trip to the toilet. While Louis and Harry are washing their hands, they grin at each other in the mirror, and Louis has a flashback of that night a few days ago, when they bumped into each other for the first time in years. Louis didn't think later on that he'd be having so much fun with this boy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His thoughts are cut short when Harry starts smiling at him quite maliciously, and Louis doesn’t have time to register anything, because then Harry is splashing the tap water at him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis lets out a quite embarrassing yelp, and he gapes at Harry, incredulous. He doesn’t take him long to come to his senses, though, and soon enough, Harry’s shirt is soaked in turn, Harry giggling without a care in the world.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(Who <em>is </em>this boy, and why is he so<em> cute</em>?)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When they exit the bathroom, William gives them the once-over, smirks knowingly, and doesn't say anything.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is grateful for that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After their meal, they decide to do something not too violent for their stomachs, and so they choose to do the Deep Creek Lake Pontoon Tour, which lasts approximately one hour. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On the boat, they can sit back (Harry sits next to Louis), relax and enjoy the beauty of the lake. Louis snaps some pictures of the mountains and trees, angling his camera so that he can also capture the flawless blue sky. It's a heavenly sight, and Louis sighs contently, enjoying the tour while the tour guide offers them local knowledge, tidbits, and history about the place.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Nice camera,” Harry tells Louis when the latter lowers it to observe the landscapes with his own eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis turns his head, smiling at Harry. “Thanks. It was a present from my dad.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis has never considered himself a good photographer, and certainly not a pro. But he does enjoy snapping pictures now and then. He thought photography was going to be his passion, until he realized he was a bit shit at it. Nevertheless, even if his shots weren’t perfect, he still liked them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’ve always enjoyed photography myself,” Harry informs.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah?” Louis brings the camera to his eyes, mostly to hide his smile. Looks like Harry and him keep having lots of common interests.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes,” Harry hums. “Don’t you think that cloud looks like a dick?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis pulls his camera away from his face, glaring at Harry. “Not again.” But he can’t hold back his laughter any longer, and soon enough they’re back with their silly game of guessing what forms the clouds look like.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Every time, Louis makes Harry giggle a little too loud while the tour guide is still talking, and every time Will turns around in his seat to glare at them, yet the upturn of the corners of his mouth indicates he has been listening to them for a while and despite it all, he finds Louis' thrilling remarks very funny.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles to himself, feeling proud for some reason.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(At some point though, Will does threaten them to be kicked out of the boat if they keep being troublemakers, and so Louis and Harry stop their game and try to act like responsible teens.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After their boat ride, Will announces it's time for him to go join his friends.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You guys be careful, and don’t go too far away, all right?” Will says, pointedly looking at his brother. “Mom would kill me if something happened.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry rolls his eyes, his mouth twitching. “I’m a responsible person. And we won’t be long before joining you and your friends.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Will purses his lips but nods. He claps his brother on the shoulder and throws a grin at Louis. “See you two later. Have fun.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It doesn’t take long for Louis and Harry to decide what to do next. They both fancy some whitewater rafting, and since they both did that once already, they don't need to be shown how to hold a paddle. They get on the boat quickly, excited to start. A professional has to climb with them, of course, and once they are all set, they start rafting in the clear and deep water of Western Maryland.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The activity is filled with laughter from both of them. They get soaking wet and are overall doing all right with the boat, and the guide offers them compliments. The boys grin at each other, high fiving in triumph, at least as much as they can manage while holding their paddles.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After this very physical activity, Louis and Harry head to the beach area at Deep Creek Lake State Park, where there’s a bunch more stuff to do.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They both agree on doing some kayaking, and they rent a double red canoe for one hour, which costs them $34.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Funnily enough, they are bit terrible on their kayak. Despite their poor skills, the kayak is easy to use, so they quickly get the hang of it. They happily paddle away, drinking in all the sights, sounds and smell of the lake. They have a brilliant time, and they enjoy the beautiful scenery as they go. What else could they ask for?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After their wild session of kayak, around 4:45pm, they decide to take a break and rent two chairs to go relax on the beach. (Honestly, renting chairs is absurd to Louis - as if they weren’t paying enough, but eh.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I'll go order something,” Louis suggests while Harry lays down on his chair, putting some sunglasses on. “Do you want anything?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mmh, an ice cream would be nice,” Harry demands, smiling at Louis with a hand against his forehead to shield himself from the sun and see Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The latter nods, and before Harry can give him the money, Louis refuses it with a shake of his head, trotting towards the stand. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Louis!” Louis laughs, ignoring Harry’s complaints. “Get me vanilla, please!” Louis throws a thumbs-up in response over his shoulder, and he comes back a few minutes later with vanilla for Harry and a popsicle for himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They eat their frozen desserts in silence, bathing in the hot sun, the air filled with some children’s screams and laughter, playing in the water with their parents watching them from their chairs or towels.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"This place is too nice. I'm not ready to leave,” Louis whines while he watches, amused, as Harry licks a bit of ice cream falling from his cone. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah, same. I love this place,” the boy replies. "Shame we have to go so soon. I would have brought you to play some golf.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis almost chokes on his popsicle when he snorts in fake revulsion. "Uh-uh, no way you’d ever persuade me to play golf.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's eyes meet his above his ice cream, shining with malice. "We'll see about that.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis cocks an eyebrow, but doesn’t respond to the challenge.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Random question,” Harry says, averting his gaze to the lake. “But if you were to live near the beach or mountains, what would you choose?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis hums in reflection. "Mmh, I quite love the beach. So I guess beach? But at the same time… I would enjoy a quiet place hidden in the mountains, surrounded by trees with no end in sight.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry sizes him up with an assenting smile. “Yeah… Me too.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's phone buzzes in his bag, and he struggles to find it as he bends over his chair, rummaging through his  bag. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It's Will,” he tells Louis, glancing briefly at him before reading his text. “He says he's going to the Mountain Park Café with his friends, and he's asking if we wanna join before we head home?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Sure, let's go!" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They arrive at the cosy little Café a few minutes later, and Will waves at them to draw their attention. The two boys approach the table where Harry’s brother is sitting with three boys and one girl, who has the brightest purple hair Louis has ever seen, with a pale yellow dress. It suits her. (Also, Louis never thought purple and yellow would match, but apparently it works.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Guys, this is my brother Harry,” Will introduces. “That you already know of course,” he laughs. “And this is a friend of the family, Louis.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles at them, waving shyly. "Hi, Louis Tomlinson.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The three boys introduce themselves as Terrance, Colin and Dale. The purple/yellow girl’s name is Dana, and a spark of recognition seems to be lit up her eyes when she addresses Louis.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Louis Tomlinson?" she repeats, raising an eyebrow. “I frequented your brother, Warren. Nice dude,” she says with a polite smile, but Louis knows she most likely meant they dated. "What he's doing now?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"He's at the lake, actually,” Louis answers as he budges on his seat. He’s sitting close to Harry, their elbows touching on the table. "He's working in a garage for now.” He doesn't need to add that next bit, but he does it, just in case, “And, erm, he’s going to propose to his girlfriend soon.” (It’s a lie, because Louis doesn't really know if Warren intends to do that, but Dana doesn't need to know that.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The girl’s smile doesn’t falter, and she nods at Louis. “Good for him, please send him my congratulations.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She seems all right, Louis decides.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He risks a glance at Harry, who is smiling as if he totally knew what Louis was doing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You boys want anything?” Dale asks him and Harry. “I'll pay.” He’s got a buzzed haircut and brown eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Oh no, thanks,” Louis and Harry both answer at the same time, and they look at each other with a bashful smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"We just got some ice cream, not really hungry or anything,” Louis explains, glancing at Dale, who nods. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Alright then, Terrance, another beer?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Terrance nods eagerly. "Yeah, please!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis and Harry fall in conversations with Will's friends easily. Before they arrived, they were apparently talking about gigs, and when Terrance mentions a tour date in Pittsburgh for some bands that Louis loves, his head perks up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What, they're coming to Maryland?" He tries to contain his excitement, but it’s hard.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah," Terrance replies with a nod. “That’s why we’re here. The concert is in a few days. Still not too late to buy tickets, if you're interested.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods enthusiastically. “Yeah, I may do that.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He could always go to the show with Warren, since Louis can't go alone because he is not 18 yet. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He remembers that Harry is a fan too, and he doesn't even think twice before the question go past his lips. "Would you like to come?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's eyes briefly widen at the proposition, before his face splits into a giant smile. "I'd love to.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Cool.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They stare at each other, wearing the same cheerful and bright smile, so they don't see it when Terrance looks at Will with a questioning but knowing look.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Will returns it with a shrug, hiding his smile behind his glass.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Before the sun sets, Will and the boys have to go back home on boat, so they quickly part away from Will's friends.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On the boat, Louis relaxes with Harry as Will drives away, content of their journey.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis almost dozes off, the exhaustion catching up on him a little. But he is woken up from his slumber when Harry gently nudges his shoulder, a grin on his face. "Next time we go to Wisp Mountain, we will play golf.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ugh.” Louis pretends to gag and closes his eyes again, but he still smiles lopsidedly at the boy. "Fine, I'm sure I'll beat you anyway. You know, beginner luck and all,” he smirks. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry curls his lip in a supercilious smile, sneering. It comes out more adorable than anything. "We'll see about that,” he says for the second time of the day.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis opens his eyes again, narrowing his eyes at Harry in defiance.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Usually, Louis isn’t that into golf. But that might just change.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Will docks the boat in front of the Tomlinson’s, Louis is surprised when Harry gets out of the boat with him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I had a very good day today,” he says beamingly, looking as charming and lovely as ever.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods, a little smile forming on his lips. “Yeah, so did I.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He can't help himself but observe Harry a few seconds. He’s bathed in the orange color of the sun. He looks radiant, and his skin looks so soft and slightly red despite all the sunscreen he applied on his body. He looks… breathtaking.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis clears his throat, snapping himself out of his contemplation. He glances at Will with a smile. "Thanks for today, Will.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man gives him a salute gesture, nodding his head with a similar smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis goes back to looking at the cute boy in front of him, who surprises him even more when Harry draws him into an embrace.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis relaxes promptly, wrapping an arm around the boy’s waist, his cheeks burning hot because he knows Harry’s brother is watching them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He pulls away first, but Harry still flashes him a grin one last time, before waving and getting on the boat. He quickly turns towards Louis again though, a visible hopeful expression set on his face. “I'll see you tomorrow?” His voice sounds as hopeful.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Who is Louis to deny him?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So he nods, because he’d really like that. He wants to see Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Of course.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry gives him a dimpled smile, and then he and Will drive away, Louis staying a few more seconds on the deck, observing the boat drifting, not being able to wipe the stupid smile off his face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(But hey, no one can see him and mock him for his little growing crush on Harry Styles, so fuck that.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>

  <span class="s1">When Louis gets in the house, the kitchen is full of life, Elizabeth and Jeanne just about finished with setting up the table for dinner, Tristen cooking it still.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Louis, you're finally home,” Natasha exclaims when she arrives in the living room with Erin in her arms. She carefully puts her down, and the little toddler promptly trots towards Louis, who bows down to pick her up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"How are you doing, little bug?" he inquires softly, caressing her cheek with a finger.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Very good,” she exclaims happily, but Louis can hear the tiredness in her voice.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The kids spent the whole day in the water,” Natasha says with a tired laugh, watching Erin fondly as she settles in Louis’ arms, resting her little head on his shoulder. “And Jeanne fell asleep outside and got a nasty sunburn.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis lets out a chortle, not taken aback by the news. Jeanne can fall asleep everywhere, so it’s no surprise she would fall asleep under the cosy but intense warmth of the sun. “The usual, then.” Because, besides her sleeping tendencies, the girl tends to get sunburns easily. (It’s mainly because she always refuses to put on some sun protection. So really, her fault.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Erin starts stirring in Louis’ arms, apparently wanting to be set free. He smiles and puts her down, fondly watching her carrying herself on her little legs in the direction of the kitchen as Natasha laughs at her daughter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So...” she then inquires to Louis with a mischievous smile, crossing her arms over her chest. One strand of hair falls onto her eyes and she puts it back by running a hand through her hair. “How was your day with Harry?" She raises one single eyebrow, a gesture quite cool that Louis learned to master over the years, thanks to his mom’s help.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"My day with Harry <em>and Will </em>was great, thanks for asking,” he answers with a roll of eyes, trying to contain his smile but failing miserably.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mm-hmm…” Natasha hums in response, a knowing smile now lighting up her face. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis narrows her eyes and watches her in silence. Then, “I don't like that look.” Natasha wiggles her eyebrows, and Louis decides it’s time for him to take his cue. “Yep, I'm gonna walk away now!” He makes his way towards the stairs and throws a wave over his shoulder. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha laughs heartily behind his back, and Louis pretends to ignore the, “I’ll interrogate you later”.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Yeah, right.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(Louis mentally reminds himself not to find himself alone in the same room as his mother for the rest of the evening.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So… You would think that, with <em>eleven</em> children, it's easy to escape a tête-à-tête with your mother. Usually, it’s because she is too busy with the other kids, the younger ones demanding attention, or because she is simply doing too many chores to catch up with every one of her children.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But mothers <em>always</em> find a way.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It’s dinner time, and the Tomlinsons are all enjoying spaghetti. The affair is rather quiet, except for that part where everyone was commenting on Mary's piercing. Because everybody had an opinion, of course. (Natasha doesn’t entirely approve, Tristen pretends he dislikes it too for his wife’s sake, but Louis catches his father puts his lips in appreciation at Mary and a sneaky thumbs-up is sent away. Louis hides his smile behind his fork.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen asks him about his day, and so Louis gladly tells them all about Wisp Mountain. He also brings out his discovery of a golf course there, and asks Eliza if she would like to go someday, since she loves golfing. (Louis really doesn’t know how she got into this… Can he call that a ‘sport’?) The girl’s expression turns delighted, and she nods excitedly at her brother, asking him if he'll drive her to the resort himself. Louis incontestably obliges. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Anyway, by the end of this evening meal, Louis thinks his mother forgot.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Unfortunately for him, Natasha finds a way. She always does. She delivers Elizabeth from her dishes chore, and assures with a toothy grin that Louis can do it instead.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The news is obviously welcomed by a cheer from Elizabeth, while Louis groans into his napkin, glaring at his mother who, in turn, gives him a complacent smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis hates her. (Not really, but you know what he means.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He's just starting to put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher when his mother joins him to help. She doesn't start asking right away, but Louis knows it is undoubtedly coming.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He is proved right within the next two minutes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(Oh, and one trait of character that is known in her mother, is that she is straightforward.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Do you like him?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis almost drops a dirty glass. "Mom!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What?" She turns her head at him, widening her eyes comically, as if she has asked him about the weather. "I'm just wondering.” She pretends to pour all her attention on the plates she’s trying to fit into the dishwasher.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis doesn’t give her an answer. Not right away, at least. He takes the time to ponder the question, puts the last three glasses in the machine before he straightens up and sighs heavily. “I mean…” He looks away from her eyes a seconds. “He’s nice.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mmh.” His mother tilts her head, smiling softly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">By now, Louis knows he is moving his hands everywhere. It’s something that he does when he’s nervous. “And… I don't know, we just get along very well. He’s fun and interesting to be around…” He stops himself before he starts a long list of good things to say about Harry Styles. Because there is quite a lot. He also needs to stop before he embarrasses himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But his mother is already watching him as if she’s guessed that Louis is in too deep already. Her smile is nothing but derisive. She can tell that Louis likes the boy. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Anyways!" He closes the door of the dishwasher with more strength than needed, and his mom looks at him with a glare. “Sorry," he swiftly apologizes, sending her a lopsided grin. He then opts for what he does best: changing the subject. “What do you think of Mary's piercing?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His mother’s reaction is immediate. She lets out a snort and glances away, raising one impressed eyebrow. “Well… Not my style,” she simply says, occupying herself by drying her hands on a towel. "Speaking of style, Harry is yours, right?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis gapes at her, before snapping out of it. ”Mom!” He takes the towel from her with an incredulous laugh. He shakes his head, completely astounded. "You're unbelievable.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha giggles behind her hand, apparently very proud of herself. She then looks down at him with such a loving look that Louis knows what’s coming next.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In an instant, he is drawn into a tight hug with without any warning. “Mom,” he pretends to whine, but his laugh betrays him. He returns the hug fiercely.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She doesn't need to say it aloud, but when she pulls away, her warm eyes basically say it all: “I just want you to be happy.” Louis wants to hug her again, so he does.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When he goes to bed that night, it's with a smile on his face while remembering his day with Harry. Um, Harry <em>and </em>his brother Will.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">What a day that was.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Two days later finds Louis playing soccer outside with his brothers Dan and Nathan and his sister Jeanne. Warren joins him later, but decides to stay on the bench, watching the game. Well, ‘watching’ isn’t exactly the accurate word. He pretends to distract himself by watching his siblings, when in fact everyone knows he is freaking out in the inside. Louis lasts ten minutes before calling him out. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Are you gonna keep pacing all evening?" he teases with a mischievous smile, scoring a goal. The ball went right between Nathan’s legs, who’s currently at the goal. The little boy groans in defeat.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Warren glances at Louis briefly, before deciding to avert his eyes, watching over the vast lake.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Why is he so nervous?" Daniel asks, running a hand through his wet hair. He’s been sweating so much, and decided to repel the heat by diving into the lake at least three times already.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Today has been a chill day. Well, as chill as it could possibly be. They’ve been playing for a while now, after spending all day together doing a family activity, just as Tristen wanted. They went all fishing in the morning (at Louis and Eliza's greatest displeasure), and then had a picnic, surrounded by nature. Then they took the boat, and had a swim, Daniel proudly showing his diving skills, as always. By three o’clock in the afternoon, they were joined by the twins William and Erica Styles, but with no Harry Styles in sight.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis tried not to be disappointed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After all, he and his siblings had spent the two last days attached at the hip with Harry and his respective siblings. Yesterday again, Harry was inviting Louis and his siblings over. They baked pancakes. (Well, Harry and his sister Vicky did. Louis was quite useless in the kitchen, and he instead sat on a stool and watched the Styles worked together. The pancakes were delicious, at least). Harry even showed Nathan his medals collection (apparently Harry is very good at science), and on the way home, Nathan had declared to Louis that he wanted to become a scientist in the future, “Like Harry,” he said Louis tried very hard to hide his smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Anyway, Louis' saddened expression must not have gone unnoticed like he hoped so, because Harry’s oldest brother Will patted him on the shoulder, informing him that Harry was having a last minute trip to the town center with the younger siblings. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shrugged it off with a smile, and trying not to think of Harry Styles looking after his siblings, he went under water to hide himself. (Will seems very perspicacious. Too many people around him seem to have caught up on his attachment to Harry already, and Louis wonders if he needs to be more careful, if Harry had noticed something, or if Louis is just that obvious and Harry is that oblivious. Anyway, bottom of the line: Louis needs to be more careful.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">One person who seems to be very obvious too, is Warren Tomlinson. If Louis had any werewolf abilities, he’d say his brother is reeking anxiety.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">What is happening is that Warren’s girlfriend, Emma, is joining the family for a few days. But that’s not the reason why Warren is so nervous. The real reason is, and Louis learnt that just this very right morning, that the day where it rained like hell, Warren and Tristen went through every single jewelry shops in town to find the perfect… engagement ring. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Yes, the eldest kids of the Tomlinsons is going to get engaged. Well, if Emma accepts, that is. When Louis joked about a possibility of refusal over breakfast, Warren almost choked on his cereals, with their mother clapping the young man on the back while glaring at Louis. Of course, all the other kids found it funny.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Then ensued an argument about who is gonna be the best man (Louis, of course), and Mary auto-claimed herself as the wedding planner. Then breakfast became too noisy, and Natasha told them all to get out of the kitchen when Warren seemed to be losing it at hearing the simple word ‘wedding’. (Seriously, he started blinking so fast, as if sending Morse Code… And his face was as red as a tomato. Louis is so not ready to propose. He doesn't want to die of stress so young.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is violently snapped out of his thoughts by the ballon kicking him in the rib. He immediately grimaces in pain, letting out a whine as he closes his eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Dan,” he groans, because even though he didn’t see which direction the ballon came from, it has to be him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When he manages to open his eyes, Dan has his little hands up in the air, an innocent grin on his face. Then he points at Jeanne. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey,” the younger girl immediately protests.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And so the two kids start their daily argument of the day while Louis and Nathan take that as the end of the game. They plop down to the ground, and Nathan watches Louis with big, questioning blue eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Why is War so nervous?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles at him and affectionately ruffles his hair. "Grown up business,” he simply replies, but it does the trick, because Nathan makes a face and pretends to gag. He pushes himself off the ground, and dares Daniel into participating in a wrestling tournament. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The day after that, around two in the afternoon, Louis is laying on a sun chair next to Eliza's, just enjoying some quietness and bathing in the sun, when the sound of an incoming car gets his attention.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis sits upward just as a Range Rover pulls over, and a beaming smile makes his way onto his face when Harry gets out of the car, looking very good. He’s dressed in a mauve tank top, jean shorts, and white sandals that Louis recognizes as Adidas ones.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Instead of blurting out a random comment, or just overall embarrassing himself, Louis directs his attention to the car, letting out a whistle. (As if he was more impressed by the car than Harry.) “I didn't know you owned such a car.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry gives him a dimpled smile and shakes his head with a gentle huff. "I wish! It's my dad's.” He nods at Louis' sister. "Hi, Eliza!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She beams at him, standing besides Louis, ready to go.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Admittedly, when Louis made the mistake to mention going golfing with Harry, he hadn’t expected his whole family to startle at the news, as if Louis golfing was the shocking and oddest thing they’ve ever heard.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You hate golf,” Eliza had huffed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To which Mary had laughed and retorted, “Damn, you must really like that boy.” (Louis had, of course, strongly ignored her comment.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So here is Louis, dressed in his best golfing clothes. (Honestly, just some short and white top, which he hopes will do). He half expected Harry to show up in tweed suits with plus fours, exposed woolen socks and thick-soled leather shoes. (Harry had laughed a bit at that, before reassuring him that there was no dress code, and it was just a simple, chill golf club at the resort.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But eh, anyway… He doesn’t care. He is going to spend the day with his little sister, and Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They’re going to golf.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis doesn't know how to golf.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This is going to be a disaster. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Nineteen minutes later, and they’re at Wisp Resort.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The vacation place offers three huge golf courses, and Harry lets Louis and Eliza decide which one they want, although he seems to like the one named "Fantasy Valley Golf Course” best.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So of course, with an understanding exchanged glance at each other, Louis and Eliza choose that one, earning in return a surprised, delighted smile from Harry. Louis swears his emerald eyes shine brighter than ever at that moment. Not that he’s paying attention to Harry’s eyes, of course.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Fantasy Valley Golf Course is 6,911 yards, and is designed around the contours at the base of Wisp ski slopes. Therefore, the trio has a breathtaking views of the green mountains. Now, Louis is no professional when it comes to golf courses, but the circuit seems in good condition, with a great layout, wide fairways and huge greens in excellent shapes, with flagsticks and holes everywhere.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It's a very sunny day, the weather is warm, and Eliza is already jumping with excitement as Harry explains the rules to Louis as best he can. It's not that complicated, Louis will admit it, and he thinks he understands most of it, trusting Harry and his sister to help him along the course. After all, he just has to throw the ball into a hole, right?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">While Eliza is thoughtfully choosing her club, Harry is giving Louis some tips, claiming than “the more loft, the better.” Whatever that means.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"If you say so, Harold, honestly, they all look the same to me,” he says in amusement, examining one club with fake attention, before shrugging. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shakes his head with a fond smile and gives Louis a club made of wood with a wink.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis bites back a smile and shoves it carefully into his golf bag.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza, apparently now satisfied with her choice, comes to join them. “We should hit the driving range before heading out onto the course, shouldn't we?" she proposes, directing her question to Harry particularly. She pops her gumdrop, laying twinkling eyes on her brother. "You know, for Lou,” she clarifies, as if Louis didn’t know already that he was an outsider to this world. (He hates the fact that she knows something he doesn't. It’s not his fault that he never was interested in golf… Ugh, why did he agree to this again!?)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry nods excitedly at Eliza, apparently finding this idea very good. His gentle gaze lands on Louis, and Louis forgets why he was internally whining. He can’t pretend to be mad, not when Styles is watching him like he is so, so happy to be here, ready to make Louis live the best experience ever.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Well, shit, Louis is <em>so</em> fucked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Come here Lou,” the curly haired boy says joyfully, and Louis almost chokes on his saliva when he swallows. The nickname is back, back again. “I'll teach you the basics.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis catches his sister biting her lips, either to hide a laugh, or just a smile. Either way, Louis pointedly tries to not look at her, while praying that Harry won’t notice her lack of subtlety.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza wastes no time knocking some balls when they arrive at the driving range, while Harry happily shows Louis how to shoot. He shows him the right position in no time and as if he’s been doing this his whole life, and Louis doesn’t know why he is surprised. Harry has probably been golfing for a while now.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As he watches Harry place his feet on the ground, gripping his club firmly, Louis tilts his head, admiring him. (What? Harry can't see him after all, his back is facing Louis. He can allow himself this one little thing, can’t he?)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shakes his head. He needs to get his act together. “How long have you been golfing?” he asks, hoping that the discussion would distract him at least.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The curly haired boy lifts his head to look straight ahead of him, probably judging the distance and trajectory. He swings slightly, answers casually, “Since I was 8,” before hitting the ball and sending it fly away. Louis has a hard time drifting his eyes from Harry’s behind to the actual scene unfolding. Right, golf.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">God, he’s terrible. He shakes himself out of his thoughts and Harry turns towards him with a beam, opening his arms.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“See, it's easy! The weather is nice, not windy at all, so it won't affect our shots. It’s perfect!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza hums in agreement, and she places her ball before performing a perfect shot, just as Harry did. (Not that Louis would know, because he was busy admiring Harry's profile while the boy was watching his sister.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Okay, fuck! He’s here to play golf! He better pay attention and get interested in the game, or else he’ll make a fool of himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Come on, Lou,” Eliza encourages after her shot, turning to him with a smirk. "Time to practice your nonexistent golfing skills.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis gives her a fake amused smile, but takes place on the range without a word. He needs to concentrate, come on. He can do this.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He tries to mirror what they both did, and he can feel Harry standing a few feet behind him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Make sure your grip fits your hand,” Harry informs him, helpful as ever.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis adjusts his hands, gripping the club firmly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He's starting to focus, his tunnel vision narrowed down, staring at the flag.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza interrupts his concentration with a, “I’m going to buy some snacks, I'll be right back.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis closes his eyes and holds back a sigh. He looks over his shoulder and sees her proud smirk, and he totally knows she did this on purpose.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She nods at Harry with a raised eyebrow, and at that moment she looks so much like their mother, Louis wants to laugh. She is also just as sly. “I expect you to have taught him everything once I get back.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And with that, she turns around, her long ponytail bouncing as she takes leave.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis turns his head to hide his smile from Harry, looking into the distance of the green course. He loves his sister.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He hears Harry chuckle and steps closer to him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Okay, so…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shows Louis how to get him into a good setup, how to check the ball position and posture and swing all the way to a full finish. He points to the red flag, informing Louis this is the target he should aim for. (Louis would have guessed on his own, but he bites back a comment and smile by biting down his lips.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Of course, there are a few instructors on the course, but Louis is glad to have Harry Styles as his mentor. Louis doesn’t want to be biased, but Harry is the finest of all.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It's just—</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The boy seems totally in his element. While he shows Louis the basics, he shuffles every time a little closer, and Louis has to control himself not to lean onto him. He doesn't want to scare Harry away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At some point Harry is so close that Louis totally misses his shot. (Maybe he should go ask an instructor to teach him instead, after all, they are golf professionals, and they won’t be <em>distracting</em>…) But then, despite his failed attempt, Harry beams at Louis, and Louis feels warm and giddy, and he really doesn’t want another instructor.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Besides being a good teacher, Harry is also very patient. While Louis groans at each of his misses, Harry laughs, not mockingly, never mockingly, and nudges Louis’ shoulder, gently telling him, “Don’t get frustrated, it takes time, patience, and practice, that’s all.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(And honestly, Louis knows golf is a game that requires a lot of patience, thank you very much, but patience is not his strong suit... But for Harry, he figures he can make an effort.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Eliza comes back to them (she <em>oddly </em>took her time, but whatever), with different snakes in her hands for them, Harry steps back and Louis can finally breathe a little.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He is really, really, really, fucked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They move to a pitch to start their course, and Louis expected to start the game right away, but instead Harry, being the serious and dedicated golf player that he is, starts stretching for at last two minutes. He must take Louis’ stare on him in as a sign of interrogation, because Harry laughs as he bents forward, fingers touching his toes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"A full day of golf can provoke a great strain in your back later, trust me,” he simply justifies himself. When Louis glances at his sister, the latter is nodding seriously, and she promptly imitates Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis purses his lips, hiding a laugh. He pretends to roll his eyes, and proceeds to extend his arms up (because as much as he hates stretching, he also recognizes that they’re the ‘professionals’ here, so he should take example on them). Then Harry has the good sense to put on sunscreen, and Louis and Eliza borrow his, because they totally forgot to bring theirs.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(It’s cute how Harry came prepared. Louis tries not to think too much about it.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It turns out that the course’s difficulty is… higher than Louis had expected. All right, he knows he doesn’t have a lot of experience (not to say ‘not at all’) but he really thought golf was easy, that you just had to get your grip right, the good posture, swing right and everything.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But no. It’s more than that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So while Louis laments on the difficulty of it all, he also admires Harry’s eased skills. Because of course the boy would simply be excellent at golfing. (He’s even better than Eliza.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Truthfully, Louis wishes he could say he didn't spend the last ten minutes admiring Harry's slender body, but... That would be a lie. At several points, Louis had to mentally shake himself by the shoulders, clear his throat and look away. Unfortunately for him, Eliza caught his admiring and lingering gaze on Harry a few times, and at some point she even widened her eyes at him, silently telling him that he isn't being very discreet.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And seriously, what in the hell is happening to Louis?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So he tries to spend the rest of the resting time pouring all his frustrating feelings into his strokes, only hitting his sister once in the process of making his shots. (It was her fault, she was standing too close to him, okay?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Overall, they have fun. Louis spends the majority of the game yelling ‘FORE’ whenever someone is about to be hit by a ball. (Most of the times, they’re Louis’ balls.) And every time, Harry laughs boisterously. It does things to Louis, he doesn’t know what these things are, really, but he does feel the proud grin on his face every time he manages to draw a laugh from the boy. (Eliza rolls her eyes every time, probably seeing right through Louis’ game.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At some point, when Harry is standing far away on the course, near the putting green and preparing his shot, Eliza shuffles closer to her brother. The latter notices her sly smirk, and he instantly knows she's going to make a remark about Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I feel like I'm third-wheeling.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He chokes on his saliva, having not really expected this. "What!? Why?” He widens his eyes at his sister, glancing at Harry briefly just to make sure that he is still out of earshot.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But Eliza doesn't answer him, only rolling her eyes and cheering when Harry pokes his ball inside the hole.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They spend the rest of the afternoon playing, and around six in the afternoon, when the sun is no longer shining as bright as ever, they finish their course and decide to go to the café Louis and Harry went last time with Will and his friends.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(To sum the whole thing up: Louis ended up being last, but he and Harry had found themselves having so many fit of laughters, so really, this torturing game was worth it.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry drives Louis and Eliza back home right before dinner time comes. The girl hugs Harry goodbye, and thanks him heartedly for the cool day.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It was my pleasure, Eli,” Harry replies with a smile, hugging her back. (Louis ignores the way his heart melt at the nickname.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza pulls away and glances at Louis briefly, before waving at Harry one last time, and then she enters the house, leaving her brother to bid Harry goodbye.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis looks down at his shoes, feeling suddenly unsure and shy. The surrounding around them is peaceful, the nature progressively falling into a slumber, the sun sitting down. It’s a total contrast to what is happening inside Louis. He feels like everything has fallen into a total frenzy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When he finally composes himself, he looks up at Harry. The boy's face is painted in orange, just like that last time Harry and his brother dropped Louis off. His curls are a mess now, far from looking as his neat hairstyle of earlier. Still, he looks so good, very good. Louis feels a little bit overwhelmed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And when he finally regains the capacity of talking, he offers Harry a bashful smile. "Thanks for today, Harry. I had a good time. <em>We</em> had a good time.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The corners of Harry’s mouth lift upward, blinding Louis with a huge smile on his face. It puts the glowing of the sunset rather pale in comparison. “It really was great,” Harry says softly, sweetly. His beam turns into a contented smile, but suddenly he seems… As shy as Louis feels right now. (At least, he isn't the only one affected, he thinks.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Erm, I was thinking…” Harry's voice seems hesitant, now, completely unsure. His eyes avert from Louis’ a second. “Would you like to go to the movies someday? Just... You, and me?” He doesn't meet Louis' eyes as he speaks the last part, instead his gaze directed on the lake on fire.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis’ breath inches at the question, and he takes him a few seconds to make sure he’s heard right.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Because… Harry is basically asking him out right now, isn’t he...?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah," Louis answers without hesitation, although his excited reply comes out as shaky as he feels right now. Still, a smile breaks his heated face. “I’d love to.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s attention goes to him, looking like a surprised puppy. Louis can only giggle, actually <em>giggle</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Great!” Harry's expression regains confidence then, his eyes smiling too. “So… it's a date?” He pronounces the end like a question, like he wants to know if Louis is on the same page as him. Louis bites his lips, smiling shyly, profusely ignoring his cheeks heating up. They definitely seem to be on the same page, and Louis could jump. He wants to explode, unable to contain his joy. “It's a date.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s smile, Louis would say, is then more blinding that when the sun is at midday. If Louis could snap a picture right now, he would put the photography next to the word ‘happiness’ in the dictionary. But eh, Louis can’t blame the boy. He feels the same.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Let's say tomorrow night?” Harry proposes. "The showings in the evening are usually early, so we could have dinner later?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods promptly. “Sounds great to me.” Harry could suggest redoing that whole parkour in the air they did at the resort last time, and Louis would agree in a heartbeat.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Great,” Harry exhales, a grin on his face. “So, I’ll see you tomorrow.” Harry then bites his lip, and Louis mirrors him, before remembering he should answer Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah, see ya.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry surprises him (once again) by dragging Louis into a hug. This time however, Louis is more prepared and quick to respond, wrapping Harry's waist with one arm and squeezing slightly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Harry pulls away, his face is still lit up by a warming and sweet smile. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The younger boy waves one last before climbing into the car, and Louis wishes he could climb too, spending the rest of the evening with Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But he figures he'll have all the time to do just that tomorrow night.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis drags himself to the house, cheeks hurting himself, and probably a bit red. They're certainly not red from the sun (because Louis had refused to put too much sun protection on.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So is that what bliss feels like?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Dinner is a surprisingly calm affair. Louis and Eliza are asked about their day, and he is grateful that no one teases him about Harry. (Because it seems like almost everybody has caught up on his little crush. Yeah, Louis had accepted it as it is.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis had managed to steer clear of his mother for the night, that is until he finds the woman after dinner, putting some nail polishes away, in a drawer. The woman had spent the last few minutes painting Erin’s little nails after Elizabeth had done hers, so obviously Erin wanted to copy her big sister.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When she spots him in the doorframe, a big smile makes its way onto her face, and she instantly grabs him by the arm, like an actual high school girl, waiting to hear all the gossips. She truly can be the worse. Louis loves her. She is his mother, sure, but Louis honestly considers her as his best friend.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After all, she has always been there for him. Through the ups and downs, through his baby steps, to his first words, hell, for his first poop even, for his first day of school, for his first fall out with his friend, for his first heartbroken love experience, through his sexuality orientation crisis… And she’s loved him, and supported him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis feels so lucky to have her, because in spite of having so many kids to handle, she always makes sure to have time for everyone. Not once in his life did Louis feel alone. She says it’s her job, and that she will always love and cherish her kids.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Yeah, Louis loves his mother so much.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Aw, my son Louis,” she sighs softly, eyeing him with recognition in her eyes. Louis arches an eyebrow, and for some reasons that makes her shake her head fondly. “I didn’t know you liked golf… But I guess once there’s a boy you like involved, you are allowed to have a change of heart, right?” she says conspiratorially.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shakes his head with a huff, feeling his cheeks heating up. “He asked me out on a date today,” he blurts out, and Natasha's eyes widen, mouth opening slightly, before a pleased grin appears on her face. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What!? Harry Styles did?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis can’t help but roll his eyes. “No, the Prince Henry of Wales did… Of course, Harry Styles!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She gives him a deadpan look for about two seconds before her grin takes over her whole face. “This is great, Lou,” she tells him, tone oddly emotional.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis gives her an uncertain smile, feeling suddenly insecure. “You think so?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And of course, being the mother that she is, she hears the lack of assurance in his tone. “Lou, yes, baby. Don't you worry about it, it's going to be great.” She wraps an arm around him, hand rubbing his arm. “Harry seems like a nice kid, and although I don't see you very often now because you tend to disappear with him—” Louis huffs at that, “—it pretty much confirms me that you like to spend time with him, and that you two get along.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We really do.” Louis confirms with a nod, smiling a little. “I... I like him, Mom,” he admits lowly, because it’s just simply the truth.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And I'm sure he likes you too,” a voice chimes in, and Louis would usually be bothered that someone was eavesdropping their conversation, but when he notices it’s only Mary, he stays silent.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary is usually always spot on when it comes to this kind of things, so Louis is curious to hear what she has to say. Plus, besides his mom, Mary is usually helpful when he seeks out advice. In fact, she pretty much knows everything about Louis' relationships since Louis confided in her a lot.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And Louis was actually intending to ask her for advice about tomorrow night. Like, how should he dress, if he should opt for casual or more formal clothes. (After all they're just going to the theaters… But after that, they're having dinner? So like, what kind of dinner, at a small or fancy restaurant? Fast food? Who the hell knows? And fuck, Louis' brain is starting to overthink already.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Jeez, Louis, breathe,” Mary tells him, interrupting his panicked train of thoughts. She’s watching him with knitted eyebrows, lips pursed. “You're not going to pass out on us, are you?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis doesn’t even have the energy to roll his eyes. “No, don’t be silly.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Good,” Mary sighs in genuine relief. “We have enough stressed Tomlinsons on our hands.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha nods scarcely at her daughter's words, and Louis frowns, looking between the two women.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Oh, Warren went out to town with Emma,” Mary tells him, wiggling her eyebrows. “He's going to propose tonight.” She takes a look down at her watch. "I wonder how things are going.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' mouth opens in shock, at a loss of words. He didn’t know Warren was planning on doing it <em>tonight.</em> When he looks at his mother for confirmation, Natasha is already nodding, a grin from ear to ear.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis laughs incredulously, feeling genuinely happy (and nervous) for his brother. “I can't believe he's going to propose to her.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He hopes Emma says yes. They’ve always made a great couple together, and she is a very nice young girl. Her family seems all right from what Louis has seen so far over the last two years. He’s just very glad his brother has finally found someone after all this time. He never had the easiest relationships with women.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis’ mom pretends to wipe her eyes, but Louis knows she must be feeling very overwhelmed and ecstatic. “I can't believe my first baby is getting married. And now my other baby—”, she shakes Louis gently by the shoulders, “—is going on a date.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis bites down his lips to both contain a groan and his smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary laughs at her mother’s antic, flipping her blonde hair over her shoulder. “And one of your other babies got a piercing,” she exclaims with a fake enthusiasm, sending two thumbs-up in his mother’s direction, at which Natasha pretends to scowl, before joining Louis in laughing. She drags both her kids into her arms.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary lets out an indignant sound at that, but lets herself be hugged anyway, Louis finding himself sandwiched between the two women.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You know,” he tries to say, his cheeks being squashed. “I love you both too, but please stop choking me. I’d like to live tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha laughs tearily as Mary coos. "Awww, don't die before your rendezvous with your boyfriend?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He's not my boyfriend,” Louis quickly counters, making Mary smirk knowingly, as if she was waiting for that particular comment. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yet.”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the morning, the Tomlinsons seem to be all wide awake when Louis rolls out of bed. Most of his younger siblings are still having breakfast with their parents seated at the table, even though they themselves are not eating anything. Louis is not surprised to see that Warren and Emma are not there. (Louis heard them come home around two in the morning last time, but Warren never made it to his bed, so Louis assumed he went to sleep (or did something else, then sleep) in Emma’s room.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis greets everyone with a hug, wondering if everything went well. He's just finished putting some Nutella onto Nathan's toast when the two love birds appears in the doorway.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Instantly, all conversations around the table gradually cease, all heads turned to observe Warren and Emma with big intrusive eyes, waiting. (The Tomlinsons have never been known for being subtle.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Emma is beautiful dark-skinned girl, standing 5' 10" tall. Her lank black hair is cascading over her slanted shoulders, hiding her small ears (Warren once admitted to Louis that it was his favorite feature on her. Weird.) Her smooth cheeks are tainted with pink as she looks between everyone in bashfulness, even though they’re both sporting a blissful smile. Louis notices their hands are hidden behind their back, and Louis guesses they're probably holding hands and…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And then Warren raises their entwined hands, a broad grin on his face, eyes sparkling with pure happiness. Louis barely catches the glint of a ring when Warren announces happily, “She said yes!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Everyone starts shouting, applauding and cheering, Natasha squealing in delight as she stands up and runs to take them both in her arms. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The whole room is filled with joy and love, and it's a splendid morning. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(Louis hopes this whole lovey-dovey atmosphere will bring him luck for his date with Harry.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is going to flip out.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He feels so freaking nervous, and it’s a bit ridiculous because after all, it’s just like another ordinary day with Harry… But truthfully, it’s not. It is so much more - Louis’ legs are shaking, and he feels like he’s going to pass out.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He's been staring at himself for the past ten minutes in the mirror, rubbing his hands over his face so much, he could rival a tomato. The expression on his face is one of pure panic, and he’s tried everything to calm down, including doing an impromptus yoga session in the bathroom. (“I swear Louis, it’s relaxing and it really works,” Eliza had told him once. Yeah. Right.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He jumps into the bath and takes the hottest shower he's ever had in his life. He takes time to carefully wash his hair, and he takes the opportunity to massage his scalp, just to relax himself. He read once that shiatsu self massage can be good, so under the warm water, he uses his knuckles to drum across the top of his head, doing light and rhythmic movements to soothe his anxiety.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">By the time he is out of the shower and standing in front of his closet, he feels a bit better. But when he tries to find something to wear, nervousness rushes back. He lets himself flop down on his bed with an anguished groan, his back on the mattress as he stares at the ceiling.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A knock on the door startles him, and Louis sits upright. “Yes?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary's pops in around the door, looking at him with an affable smile. “May I?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods, barely holding back his sigh of relief. Mary beams and gets in, closing the door behind her. She glances down at Louis’ different choices of clothes spread on Warren's bed with a thoughtful expression on. When she looks back at Louis, she giggles, apparently amused by the edgy look on his face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Need some help then?” she asks with malice, even though she very well knows the answer to that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Please,” Louis answers, wincing at the despair in his tone.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This time, Mary doesn’t laugh, and instead observes the clothes on the bed a few seconds more before turning towards Louis’ wardrobe, rummaging through it. “What are you two planning tonight?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis stands up, joining her. “Erm, we're going to the cinema, then we’ll probably go eat somewhere. I don't know if it's a restaurant, or take-away, and I don't wanna be overdressed, so maybe I should go for casual–"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Louis,” Mary cuts him off softly, turning towards him with arched eyebrows. “Breathe.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He obliges and shakes his head, laughing nervously. “I don't know why I'm so nervous!”</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His sister smiles at him as if she knows exactly what he’s going through. After all, she probably does. “It is normal to feel nervous.” She presents him one of his numerous black tops. “Here, put this on.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis tries two different outfits before deciding on a black jean with a simple white top and vans. That's what Louis feels the most comfortable in, and he thinks he looks casual enough, but not too much. Then Mary decides to do her brother’s hair, passing a hand through it with a light product. So now his hair is slightly more tame to match his super slick style (Mary’s words, not his).</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis inspects himself in the mirror for the thirteenth time. “You’re sure I look okay?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Okay?" Mary repeats after him, arching one eyebrow. “You look amazing, more like.” She smiles proudly, and Louis doesn't know if it’s because she’s proud of her investment or if it’s something else. “Harry has no reason not to like you.” More seriously, she adds, “And it’s not really the appearance that counts, Lou. If he doesn’t like you for who you are, then it’s his loss.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis wants to hug his sister, but instead he sends her a bashful smile, feeling pleased.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Suddenly the door flies open, and their mother appears in the doorway with new fresh washed clothes in her hands. When she spots Louis, she gasps and totally freezes in the doorway, before quickly putting down the clothes on Daniel's bed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh my god,” she exclaims, grabbing Louis by the forearms. “Let me look at you!” She makes a gesture for Louis to twirl, and Louis does so with a roll of his eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When he faces his mother again, she’s wearing the biggest smile ever, and, much to Louis’ embarrassment, there are tears in her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You look fantastic, Boobear.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis scrunches his nose at the nickname, but grins at the compliment. “Thanks, Mom. And thank you Mary, for helping.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary mock salutes him with a pleased smirk. “It was my pleasure, bro.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis' phone buzzes, and he hastily reaches for it, reading Harry's text message. (His heart may flip at the name of the boy.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He's here,” he announces, trying to sound casual but failing miserably. He hopes the two women don’t pick up on it. He pockets his phone and runs towards the mirror, making sure he looks presentable one last time before his mother hugs him and Mary tells him to have fun. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And no funny business,” Natasha yells after him when he exists the room. (He pretends he doesn't hear her, ignoring the heat rushing to his neck.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As he's about to open the front door, he is obviously stopped by his younger siblings reunited in the living room.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Where are you going like that?” Jeanne asks from the couch, and even Nathan and Daniel pauses their FIFA game to look over their shoulders.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Nowhere,” he answers. And rapidly, he turns around, throwing a "gotta go, bye!" before closing the door after him. Mission succeeded.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As soon as he’s outside, he stops dead in his tracks. Harry is with none other than Tristen Tomlinson, the man standing in front of Harry with crossed arms. His back is facing Louis, and Louis glares at his father’s back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Because fucking great!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He’s managed to avoid the interrogation of his siblings, but Harry couldn't escape his father.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis speedily strides towards them, announcing himself with a clear of his throat, although Harry already noticed him, if Harry’s smile was anything to go off of.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen turns around, eyeing his son's outfit discreetly - but Louis knows his father, so he catches him in it - before he shoots Harry a hesitant but polite smile, clapping him on the shoulder. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well then,” Tristen utters, in a voice that basically says, ‘I know you know what I was doing, but don’t worry, I went easy on him.’ He gives his son a grin. ”Have a good night, you two.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And with his back facing Harry, he winks at Louis. (If Louis could melt, he’s pretty sure he would already be a puddle of embarrassment on the floor.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Tristen disappears into the house, Louis chuckles stiffly, throwing a sheepish smile at the boy. "Sorry he interrogated you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But Harry simply giggles, shaking his head. A dimple has made its appearance, and Louis takes that as a good sign. “Don’t worry, my dad would have done the same thing,” he reassures Louis, opening the passenger door for him. Louis beams at that, feeling reassured and totally relaxed. He doesn’t even remember why he was nervous in the first place.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And so he climbs in, ready to have a good night with the wonderful green-eyed boy that makes his heart melt whenever he looks at him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They drive in a comfortable silence to the cinema, only commenting now and then about the music on the radio. At some point, Green Day is singing a song, and Louis can't help himself but sing loudly, immediately joined by Harry, who, Louis noticed, has a very good voice. Louis, because he’s Louis, attempts to exaggerate his voice at one point, singing awfully high, which earns him a fit of laughter from Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis feels accomplished, and he spends the rest of the ride watching outside the window, a satisfied smile hidden behind his hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They arrive a few minutes later at the Garrett 8 Cinemas place, a small theater made entirely in bricks. They stand in a huge hall, very spacious and crème, with various paintings hung on the wall. Louis recognizes Marilyn Monroe and some other famous people, but he barely pays them attention. He is too aware of Harry’s presence as they’re queuing, standing close to each other.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The whole place in itself feels homey though, and it is a bit crowded but Louis isn’t too bothered by that. After all, it’s a Saturday, and because good movies are currently screening, Louis is not really surprised.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He and Harry spend a few seconds discussing what movie they should watch, and they decide to go for the newest movie that just came out today: "The Time Traveler's Wife". The bill shows a couple, and they have no idea what the story is about, apart from time traveling.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(And well… Since they both love romantic movies... It's a good choice for them.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis may or may not be regretting their movie choice. Honestly, they did not sign up for this kind of pain. Yet here they are, watching a romantic drama that makes Louis feel so, so sad. He should have known better, since a quick check on the internet before the movie informed them that the film was based on Audrey Niffenegger's 2003 novel.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So Louis blames Audrey.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This movie —this story— is so heartbreaking. He almost cries during one scene, and he suspects Harry is tearing up as well, Louis isn’t sure since he can't quite see the boy’s face in the dark. Nevertheless, it's not all tears, because at some point Louis manages to break the whole heavy-hearted ambiance by making Harry laugh. (A guy was obnoxiously chewing his popcorn, and Louis simply yelled through his teeth, “Are you quite finished, pal?” But apparently it was hilarious to Harry.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">By the time they exit the room, movie all rolled up and with their broken hearts, Harry’s red eyes are a bit puffy, and Louis can’t hold back the coo leaving his mouth, nudging Harry's shoulder. “Aww, Harold cried.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry averts his eyes, and Louis notices the faint blush on his cheeks. (Louis is pretty sure it’s because of Louis’ comment, and not the movie.) “Don't pretend like you weren’t moved. I heard you sniffle several times.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Now it’s Louis’ turn to blush, thought he isn’t even ashamed of it. “All right, Curly, you got me there.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry throws him a triumphant smile, and it’s so endearing that Louis almost slips from the sidewalk.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They decide to get some snacks, feeling rather hungry and thirsty. (“I think my body is dehydrated. I probably cried all the water out of my body,” Harry said. So if Harry wants water, water he'll get. Sorry, but Louis doesn't make the rules).</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They keep chatting about the movie over their dinner, exchanging their opinions and then switching onto the matter of time travel. From that topic, they start discussing other movies, more specifically, sci-fi. Louis gasps so loud in the bar when Harry confesses that he’s never watched Star Wars. At his sign of astonishment, every single person present in the room may or may not have turned their head to look at them questioningly. It was fun, especially when Harry ducked his head and tried to muffle a giggle.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">During their whole conversation, Louis feels like they are in a bubble. The bar isn't crowded, so it's quite easy to get lost in a conversation, especially when you're talking to Harry Styles.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry is easy to talk to, and Louis will never admit it aloud, but he loves listening to Harry. The boy could be rumbling about the silliest things, or he could launch into a philosophical matter, and Louis would drink in every word pouring out of him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis realizes he may be too far gone already, but honestly, it's not his fault. Harry is just that charming, outgoing, nice, and funny. He's quirky too, and Louis must roll his eyes at least ten times because of the stupid jokes Harry tells and thinks are funny, but since he's Harry, Louis indulges him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In their own world, they don't even pay attention to others.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And Louis loves that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The final step to their date, it seems, is a little park near the bar they were at. Since Louis doesn't drive, he allows himself to sip on a beer, while Harry is content with his soda. They sit by the small lake, the whole place vaguely illuminated by a few street lamps. The grass is nice under the touch, Louis running his fingers through it. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Tonight was nice," says Harry next to him with a content sigh, raising his hand to take a sip of his soda.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They’re sitting together, enjoying the quietness of the night and the peaceful atmosphere that the park has to offer at that time of the night.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis hums, briefly checking the time, noting it's not even that late. "Do you want to go back now or...?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looks at him, shaking his head. "I don't mind staying here and talking a bit.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Talking, okay, yeah, all right. Louis can do that. (His mind is starting to overthink already. Not good.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Shall we do a game?" he asks. He really doesn't know why he’s asked that, probably because he has no filter and because his brain thought it was a good idea. And he just… Doesn’t know what to do. Harry is making him nervous again. He wonders if he has the same effect on Harry…? But when Louis looks at the boy’s profile, he sees anything but stress. Harry looks calm, collected, and completely unaware of Louis’ inner feelings.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry raises an eyebrow at Louis’ suggestion, promptly nodding with a smile. “Yeah, why not. What sort of game?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis opens his mouth, his eyes flickering over their drinks. "Well, since we both have something to drink...” He tries to think of a nice drinking game, his brain working a bit slow under Harry’s mesmerizing stare. "Why not the 2 lies, one truth?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry chuckles a little at that. “Isn’t it Two Truths And A Lie?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis thought it was ‘Two Lies and One Truth’. “Uh, I know the real game is the other way around, but I just figured I’d mix it up a bit.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry smirks, as if he knows Louis actually totally mixed it up. Still, he seems to indulge Louis. “Sure then,” he says, shaking his head in agreement. He starts sitting crossed-legs, facing Louis. The latter can't help but smile, and duplicates the position.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Okay,” Louis says, his fingers playing with his drink as he bites his lips. “You go first, Harold.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry indulges him with a gleeful smile, before racking his brains to find something to say.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">While Harry thinks, Louis notices, he tends to look into the void, eyes and mind losing themselves in thought. He also does this cute thing with his lips, a sort of mid-pout, and it's honestly so endearing…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Okay, Louis needs to stop. Maybe he should drown himself in the nearby lake.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Okay,” Harry exclaims, looking back at Louis with a grin. Louis blinks, focusing his attention back on the discussion. Right. The game. “I attended a school called 'Happy Day’,” Harry starts saying, raising one finger in the air. “I once wore two pairs of pants under my trousers and only became aware of it when I went to the loo,” he stops himself with a smile when Louis starts laughing. “And I ... I once ate a crayon and pooped it out later.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis cackles then, making a disgusting sound. “God, Harold, you're gross.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shrugs and raises his hands in defense, smiling slyly. “You don't even know if it's true.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis shakes his head, trying to control his laughter. His cheeks are already starting to hurt. “Well, for your sake, I hope it's not. Okay, I'll go for... The second option is the truth.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"The two pants part?" Harry quizzes, and Louis nods, although growing suspicious because of Harry’s smile screaming victory already.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shakes his head, a satisfied and victorious smile spreading on his face. "Nope, it was a lie.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis’ eyes widen in apprehension. "Please, don't tell me it's the third one.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry giggles at Louis’ scandalized expression, apparently completely enjoying this. "Nope, the truth was that I attended a school called 'Happy Day'.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis pretends to appear unimpressed. “That's it?” He shakes his head with a smile, arching an eyebrow. “Lame. But cool name though. Happy days!” He takes a sip of his beer, and realizes how silly this drinking game is. Harry is sipping soda, and Louis is going slow on his beEr. But still, it’s a nice way to get to know Harry a little more. So Louis won’t object to that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He sits upright, getting ready. “Okay, my turn!” Harry smiles widely, giving him his full attention. He’s sitting cross-legged, holding his head in his hands with his elbows propped on his knees. Louis only notices now that they're sitting quite close to each other.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Oh, and under the moonlight, Harry is very pretty. There's something about him… Like, the usual brightness of his emerald eyes look darker in the night, but still as mesmerizing. Then there is his nice and open face, his constant dimpled smile… There isn’t only his appearance, no, Louis loves how funny Harry is, and how they get along so well. Louis is really glad they’ve found each other this summer. He really loves spending time with him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I like spending time with you," he blurts out, and when he realizes what he’s just said, he mentally pinches himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry blinks in response, before a slow grin rewards Louis’ unexpected words. “Well… I hope this is the true statement, because otherwise I don't know how to take it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis chuckles awkwardly, looking away. Suddenly the lake seems very interesting. He wonders if there are ducks in there. He also wonders if he should drown himself before embarrassing himself more.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Seriously, what is this boy doing to him, for fuck's sake.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Erm, no, that wasn't part of the game. I mean! Yes, it's a true statement. I–" He stops talking, holding back the frustrated groan that he wants to give. He must be furiously blushing, but he's comforted in the fact that he isn’t alone when he glances at Harry, and he notices the boy is slightly blushing too. (It can't be the alcohol, after all, he's not drinking any.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I like spending time with you, too, Louis," Harry answers with a demure smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They stare a few seconds at each other, in which Louis starts maltreating his lips by biting them. “Cool,” he says eventually, through his big smile, Harry having one similar on his face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They return to their game after that little confession, and the atmosphere goes back to jovial and easygoing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis learns that Harry once believed that his cousin Peter was really Spiderman, and the thought of little Harry asking his cousin to throw spiderwebs (thanks to some little gadget they used to sell at the malls) has Louis giggling. In contrast to Harry’s cute stories, Louis’ anecdotes are a bit more saucy, and also gross. Like that time he once had a blowjob in his high school, and Harry pretends to be shocked but really, Louis has started to figure the boy out. He’s sure Harry isn’t that innocent, even though his angelic face can be misleading.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">What used to be a game of discerning two lies among one truth turns somehow into a game of just confessions. At some point, the game takes an unexpected turn, and it might be because of Louis’ fault. Or, you know, Louis blames it on the booze.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Okay, seriously Harold,” Louis manages to say after laughing for five minutes straight. Harry had just finished telling him that one time he cried his eyes out as a little boy because he didn't want to be carried in his aunt's arms because she had ‘huge boobs’. “This isn't a problem now, I'm sure.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s face is as red as a tomato, but Louis will put that on the account of their fits of laughter. Harry shrugs with a slight grimace at Louis’ comment. “I mean, I like girls, but boobs aren't their main trait. It’s really… not that important.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis waves his beer at him, fixing his eyes somewhere on the grass around them. He’s finished it a few minutes ago, and he wouldn’t mind more. “Fair point. I like dicks better though.” He tried to mumble his last words, but he's quite tipsy, and sharing this about him makes him feel a bit better. After all, he’s done hiding. He did that for a long time already.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There's a silence stretching, and Louis dares to look at Harry. The boy has his head tilted, observing Louis in silence with a genuine open curiosity, the corner of his lips lifter upwards. And he's still very much red in the face. “Have you—” He stops himself then, bottom lip suddenly caught between his teeth.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It’s Louis’ turn to tilt his head. ”Have I, what, Harold?” he inquires, voice tripping with friskiness. He guesses it's probably going to be a sex-related question. This is getting interesting.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry takes a deep breath, and he must take Louis’ teasing tone as a form of encouragement, because he finally asks the question. “Well, earlier you mentioned blowjobs, and I'm sure, with your good-looking physical appearance, that you—”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis doesn’t even bite his lips to contain his grin. “Are you calling me pretty, Curly?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is pretty positive the redness on Harry’s face is not due to laughter, or the coldness (not that’s it’s actually cold) around them. “I would be a fool not to notice it, because of course you’re pretty, Louis.” And it's funny, how Harry can be so bashful about sex, but so blunt and straightforward with compliments? Louis knows some people who would not, for the life of them, dare to compliment someone they like, fearing rejection. (Not that Louis is assuming Harry likes him, although he does hope so.) But Harry is just that honest, because when someone is beautiful, you just tell them, right? You’ll never know how it will make someone happy, or more confident. It can make their day sometimes. So yeah, it’s always nice to hear this kind of things. Especially when the complement comes from Harry Styles himself. (And whom Louis may or may not be falling for.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis’ eyes fall on the beer he put on the ground, his fingers playing with the bottle. “Thank you,” he answers softly, lifting his eyes to look Harry. "You are pretty too, you know.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry's grin Louis gets in response is wonderful. Harry is wonderful. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So...” Louis prompts slowly, not sure how to approach the subject Harry wanted to tackle on. “Did you wanna know if I had sex?” He ignores the fire on his neck. (Hey, he never said he didn’t get sometimes coy about it.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry seems to be glowing red now. But he still nods, before quickly adding, “Of course, it's okay for you not to say anything, I mean it's kinda private, so—”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis cuts him off by raising his hand, letting out a small chuckle. "I don't mind telling, it's alright.” Harry is just so cute. “Yeah, I did,” he says simply. He hesitates, before asking, "What about you?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry bites his lips, nodding slowly. “It was nice. She was nice.” So, it seems like Harry seems to be swinging both ways. “I don’t actually like labels,” Harry confesses with a shy shrug. “I just think... Love is love, you know? No matter what the gender is. You could very well be a woman and always be attracted to men, until you find someone and, oops, it's a woman. So what? If it's your soulmate, go for it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis tilts his head at that, watching Harry’s profile with something warm twirling in his stomach. He can’t quite put his finger on it. They switched position during their truth game, and they're now laying down on the ground, watching the stars in the sky. The sky is clear as ever, and the stars can be seen for once, shining bright. It's nice to be able to see them. That’s what Louis likes the most about this place, the fact that they’re far enough from the big cities and can enjoy the gifts that the nature has to offer. There is still no one else but the two boys in the park, and it's probably getting very late, but right now, in the middle of the night in that city, with a wonderful kind boy by his side, Louis feels content.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You believe in soulmates?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry drifts his eyes from the sky, turning his head to look at Louis, a small shy smile appearing on his lips. “I know it's stupid—”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Not stupid," Louis interrupts, blinking at Harry before smiling. “I am a firm believer in fate.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry grins at that. "Really?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yep. I'm the guy whose favorite TV show is One Tree Hill, remember?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A loud chuckle escapes Harry’s mouth at that, crinkling appearing by his twinkling eyes. Louis hadn't noticed before, but their faces are quite close. Harry must notice it too, because his laugh audibly dies down his throat, and he stares into Louis’ eyes with an opened mouth, waiting for something. Anything.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You know," Louis starts slowly, licking his lips. "This would be the perfect and romantic moment to kiss.” He honestly doesn't know if he can throw that excuse on the beer, but fuck that, because Harry actually beams and his eyes are suddenly on Louis' lips. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I agree...” the boy whispers.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Is it even okay to kiss on the first date?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Well, fuck that as well.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Their heads lean closer, and suddenly their mouths find each other, lips instantly slotting together perfectly like they were made for each other. (Blame this sappiness on the Louis’ drunken state.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Unlike Louis, Harry tastes like the soda he had earlier, mixed with what Louis recognizes as mint. (What the hell, does Harry have  freaking chewing-gum in his mouth? When did he even take one, and why didn't he offer any to Louis? He wants a refund.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But what Louis notices the most is that Harry's lips are incredibly, and pleasantly soft. Louis likes that a lot, so he parts his lips, the invitation on the tip of his tongue. Literally. Harry accepts it, allowing their tongues to meet, shyly first, but then more confidently, which brings them both to move their position a bit, one of Harry's arms wrapping around Louis' waist in an automatic movement, but it feels so familiar, so… right…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Harry draws Louis closer, so close, Louis loses the ability to breathe, and he needs to take a breath already, so he can’t help but gasp against Harry’s mouth. Their mouths only separate a few seconds before Louis is on Harry’s dewy lips again. His elbows are starting to hurt because he’s been resting on them while hovering above Harry, but he doesn’t care. It’s all worth it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But then the need to breath must be too strong for Harry, because it’s his turn to let out a shaky breath against Louis’ lips, and they break the kiss for good this time, allowing their body to reclaim some oxygen.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is left staring down at Harry in a complete daze, and he is vaguely (utterly) aware of the fact that he’s plastered against Harry's warm body, Harry’s hips connected with Louis’ stomach.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"That was...” Harry starts hesitantly, more because of his pants than embarrassment or anything. Louis is sure of that, because Harry is smiling wide, an expression of satisfaction on his face. "That was nice.” His dimples are both out, and Louis likes the fact that Harry is always smiling openly hard for him. His green eyes are taking in Louis' face, his pupils are dilated and he licks his puffy red lips with difficulty. Louis did that to him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And he wishes he could do that again, and again, and again… But… It’s getting late.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, that was nice,” he repeats after Harry, totally aware of the audible smile through his tone. “And, um, we probably should head home now...” It sounds plainly reluctant, even to Louis' ears. Harry blinks at him, and then jumps on Louis’ mouth again, and Louis immediately responds, pressing their mouths harder, breathing in through his nose and drinking in the kiss.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They probably make out for a solid ten minutes, before Louis, being the responsible person that he is, pulls away, albeit reluctantly, and announces they should <em>really </em>go now, because it's late and he isn't sure they're allowed to put on a show in a public area (although technically, there is no public to watch right now).</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">With one last peck, Harry eventually agrees and they both stand up, Louis helping Harry to stand up by pulling on his hands. He gets a good look at Harry. His curly hair is completely chaotic, and his pink lips are more than swollen. Louis wishes he could find a better word, but he can’t. Harry is truly a sight for sore eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And Harry must notice Louis is staring, because he blushes (if it's even possible, because his whole face is already flushed) and he tugs on Louis’ hands, guiding them to the exit of the park.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tonight was just the best date ever, and Louis made sure to let Harry know. (With a hickey on Harry's neck. Harry protested, not wanting to attract his family's attention because, “Louis seriously, how am I going to hide this when I'm wearing my swim trunks?”, but if the pleasured moan he let out was anything to go by, he wasn't really mad at Louis.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When they do have to part ways, standing in front of Louis' house at three in the morning, they kiss for ten minutes before saying their goodbyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis falls asleep to all these scenarios of the night, lips still tickling and heart full of something close to love.</span>

  <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Unsurprisingly, Louis sleeps in the next day.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When he wakes up and grabs his phone, his lock screen tells him it's currently 12:31pm. He glances around the room to see that both Warren and Nathan's unmade beds are empty, and so is the room. After a quick round in the bathroom, Louis receives a text message from Harry. Immediately, he grins to himself as he opens it. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>From: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Wanna come to mine today? :)</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>To: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>I'd love to ! :) Just let me eat quickly and I'll be there ! </b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>From: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Okay :D</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On his way downstairs, Louis runs into his sister, Mary, who instantly gives him a sly smile when he murmurs a weak ‘good morning’. (Louis prefers not to dwell on her expression.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When he arrives in the kitchen, Eliza is in the middle of the preparation of a salad, while Ella, Jeanne, and Elizabeth are helping her making lunch. They all look up when Louis enters, stopping their discussion. The four pairs of eyes make him nervous for some reason. He knew he hadn’t done anything wrong...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Morning," he carefully says to them, ruffling the hair on the closest sister’s head to him, which happens to be Elizabeth.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“More like afternoon,” she retorts with a snort, smirking at him. “Did you have fun last night with your boyfriend?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis almost chokes on his saliva, but he plays it cool by masking his cough in his hand, turning around to grab the box of cereal, still lingering on the kitchen table. "I had fun with my friend, yes.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He hears Eliza snort behind his back, mumbling something that awfully sounds like, “‘Friend’, right”, and Louis turns to discreetly glare at her. He doesn't need his sister to bring their youngest sisters in her twisted teasing game about his love life. (Louis is the only one allowed to tease his sisters, not the other way around, okay? Besides, Jeanne and Elizabeth are too young, okay? They're like, only 12 and 11 years old. They can't even have boys right now in their life. Nope, Louis won't allow it.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He sits at the table after finding a bowl in one of the cupboards. “Where's Mum?” he asks around his spoon.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“She went on a morning stroll with Ren and Erin," Jeanne answers him, chopping an egg into quarters. “She’ll probably be back soon.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza puts the eggs into in a medium bowl while Beth and Ella add and mix different ingredients, supervised by their big sister. Eliza is the pro of making salads.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is done with his bowl of cereal in a few minutes, and he feels Ella eye him critically when he goes to put the bowl into the sink. “You should eat more to have some strength for today,” she tells him, her blue eyes narrowed to slits.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis laughs at the random comment. “And why is that, mom?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“For the hiking,” Beth chimes in, sounding way too excited.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis freezes on the spot, eyes going between all his sisters. “The… hiking?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza takes too long to answer him, adding some mayonnaise into the plate. “Did you forget you and the boys have a hiking planned this afternoon?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis only stares blankly at her in response. Then, “Me… and… the boys?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Jeanne sighs dramatically at her brother, shaking her head as if totally done with his antics. “Yes, you and these other boys who happen to be your brothers? You know, Daniel, Nate and Ren? And dad's coming, of course he is. Oh, and Warren is excused, he’s spending time with his fiancée,” she adds that bit with a pensive gaze and dopey smile on her face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis tries to remember when he, his brothers and his dad decided to go on hiking. He honestly doesn't recall. And he hates hiking. "When did I agree to this?" he asks to no one in particular, dropping his head on the kitchen counter with a moan.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Beth pats him on the back. "You don't really have a say in the matter, you know that. Hiking is sacred.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He lifts his head with difficulty. "But I had plans with—“ He stops himself when he sees the curious and knowing looks from his sisters. "Never mind, bye.” And he leaves the kitchen, hearing his sisters giggle behind his back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He hates them. (Not really.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>To: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Can't come today, family duty (hiking UGH) and tonight's game night. See you tomorrow, I hope?</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>From: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Oh sure :) Have fun today! I’ll definitely see you tomorrow</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Honestly, it's ridiculous. Louis and Harry aren't even far away, and yet Louis can't even go see him because he’s stuck with his brothers and father for a hiking session.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Why is life enjoying making Louis suffer like this?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Have I mentioned that I hate hiking?” Louis says as he ties his shoes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Only twice," answers Nathan with a smirk, not standing quite still on his feet. He's the only one properly excited over the idea of hiking. He had made sure at least ten times that his back-bag was fully equipped, as if he was going on a true hiking adventure. (Maybe in his head, he was. For Louis, it was just torture.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Don't get him wrong, he loves spending time with his brothers and dad, but <em>hiking, really?</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I am so jealous of Warren," Louis mumbles. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His dad comes behind the couch Louis is standing on, clapping two hands on his boy’s shoulders with a tight smile. "So...” Oh, no. Louis knows that tone and look. “Did you have a good time with Harry Styles?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis hides his self-consciousness by bowing down his head, pretending to check if his laces are done right. (He’s not a kid, he knows how to lace his shoes, of course they're done right. But he wants to avoid his father's scrutinizing gaze.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah, it was alright," he only replies, opting to escape by jogging towards the kitchen, grabbing a water bottle. His dad gets the message, and doesn't push it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But that is without counting on his sister's intervention.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I think Louis' in love," sings-songs Jeanne, who's leaning against the couch, watching her brothers getting ready. She gives a sly smile when Louis discreetly flips her off, but his father doesn't miss it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He shoots Louis a reprimanding look, and the latter drops his hand and purses his lips, giving his dad an innocent smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This afternoon is going to be promising.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Twenty two minutes into their trail, and Louis and his family are finally taking a break, to Louis' greatest pleasure. He is <em>exhausted.</em> He hates hiking, has he mentioned that already?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"All right, kids, break time,” Tristen announces as they stop at in a nice little place in the forest. Louis spots a tree trunk and immediately sits down, his father following suit. It feels good to rest his behind, and giving a rest to his legs as well. Nathan and Daniel choose <em>not</em> to rest, obviously, and instead decide that poking with a stick an ant-hill they found behind a bush is the most entertaining thing ever. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As Louis takes out his water bottle from his bag, he wonders what Harry is doing. The boy sent a picture earlier; a picture of his neck. Apparently, he thought it was funny to update Louis of the evolution of his love bite. (Louis may have choked and coughed for several minutes before he found the ability to breathe again.) Harry had also sent pictures of him applying make-up to hide the mark, and Louis was honestly done with this boy, but boy, does he like him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ren,” his father calls out in alert, startling Louis a little. “Do not eat that ant.” Ren makes a sad face at their father’s warning, but crouches to put down the ant.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">During the whole trail, Tristen and Louis had to manage the three kids, who apparently must have drunk some sort of special milk this morning, because they are way too excited for Louis' liking today. They’re truly exhausting. (Thank God, his father always has a way to contain the kids, and he may or may not have blackmailed them. If they behave, they are going to the nature center afterwards. It’s calmed the boys down a bit.)</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen shakes his head at his little boy, a fond exasperated smile on his face. He glances at Louis, who had taken the momentary distraction to reply to one of Harry's texts. He knows his father's curious eyes have spotted the name on the screen, and Louis rolls his eyes when his dad arches an eyebrow in interest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Ahh, summer love," Tristen sighs with a contemplative voice, looking in the distance. "I remember those.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis huffs a snort despite the blood rushing to his cheeks. "It's not love," he denies with a shrug. He doesn’t finish the sentence by, ‘just a crush’, but his father still hears it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"So you like him?" the man asks, nudging his son’s shoulder playfully. He looks like a kid, fishing for gossip. It’s both annoying and hilarious.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">One thing Louis really loves about his father is how easy it is to talk to him. And that's something he is very grateful of, because before Louis came out, the thing that scared him the most was his parents’ reaction. He honestly didn't know where he would be right now in his life if his parents and family hadn't accepted him. He remembers crying in his mother's arms and the woman comforting him and kissing him. He remembers thanking his father for accepting him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis will always remember his father's response: "You don't have to thank me for accepting you. You are my son, and I love you. I will always love you, no matter what. It doesn't matter who you love. You could fall in love with a turtle and I wouldn't care. Okay, maybe in this case I would,” and it was just great, Louis had never felt so accepted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He knew he is lucky, because some people don't have the privilege of having such supporting parents. He hopes that these people find some other people: friends, acquaintances or associations. Nobody should ever feel like shit for loving someone else, whether they’re the same gender or not. And no one should feel lonely for being who they really are. That’s why Louis created a blog a while back, to help whoever needed to confide in. He hasn’t checked since he’s been on vacation, so he reminds himself to do it once he gets back home.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yes," Louis finally answers his dad with a tiny smile. "I like him. He's nice.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen hesitates before asking, "Do you think you'll stay in touch?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This time, it's Louis who hesitates. He honestly hasn't thought of that... Of what would happen after summer. He hasn't thought of anything at all, to be honest. They just had a date, and they kissed, and they seem to like each other, yeah. Their relationship is probably going to be a summer thing, but after? Louis doesn't know, and it's too soon for him to think of that kind of things.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So he only shrugs, inhaling deeply. "I don't know, but I'd like to, I guess.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Ewww, dad,” Nathan shrieks, jumping towards the pair on one foot, a dejected face on. "I stepped in shit," he declares with a pout.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen doesn’t even reprimand Nate for his language, instead exchanging a look with Louis before bursting out laughing, immediately followed by Daniel and Ren.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Nathan spends the rest of the trail sulking, though the whole shit issue is quickly forgotten when they arrive at the nature center and spend the rest of the afternoon at the beach, each of the boys with an ice cream in their hands.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Overall, Louis had a great day, and even though his father’s question has brought a lot of questions to Louis, he swears himself to just enjoy the moment with Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After that, what will happen? Well, only the future holds the answer to that question.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Right now, Louis is just content to text Harry with the soothing sound of the waves in the background.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That night, the game party will apparently be without Louis' parents. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Louis finally manages to have access to the shower (Nathan always takes forever), he overhears his mother talking to Mary in the master bedroom on his way to the bathroom.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’re sure you don’t mind me borrowing this blazer of yours, darling?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course not, Mom,” Mary reassures with a wave of her hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You're going out tonight?" Louis asks, leaning against the doorway, and visibly surprising the two women who jump at his sudden appearance.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Louis,” Mary chastises with a grimace. “Don’t creep on us like that.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sorry,” he giggles at his sister, eyeing his mother. The woman is standing before the mirror on the front door of the closet, visibly pondering whether the jacket looks good on her or not.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, we’re going out,” she answers her son, glancing at him with a smile. “Mary gave us the free night,” she beams. “I think Warren and Emma are going out, too.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis nods while Mary grins at him. “As you may have come to the conclusion by now, tonight I am in charge, kiddo.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis rolls his eyes. “Aren't you always?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary's left corner of the mouth twitches upward. “You got it. Oh, by the way…” She winks at Louis, meaning nothing good. “I spent the afternoon with Erica. Imagine our surprise when her brother Harry came into her room to ask for makeup.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis furrows his eyebrows, not sure where his sister is going with this. “Really…?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mm-hmm.” Damn Mary and her sly grins that say everything. Louis hates her. Thankfully, his sister doesn’t add anything more. She doesn’t mention the thing on Harry’s neck that she most likely saw.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis feels like he is going to melt with how hot his cheeks feel right now.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha, too distracted with her contemplation in the mirror, hasn’t caught any implication from the conversation, and blurts out to Mary, “So what if the boy wants to wear makeup? Let him be.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis smiles, loving his mother for being so damn amazing. “Anyway, gotta take a shower before someone else monopolizes the bathroom.” To his mom he says, “If I don't see you before you leave, have a great night!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha turns to him, blowing him a kiss. “Thanks, darling.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Louis is about to enter the shower, he sends a quick text to Harry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>To: Harry S</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>So you didn't tell me you got caught by your sister and mine today ;) </b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To Louis' surprise, he receives a picture of Harry pouting and shrugging for the show, the text only saying a single word.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <b>Oops?</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis can't stop smiling the whole way through his shower.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"></span>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>**</strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The game night becomes a pillow fight after only fifteen minutes into the board game.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It wasn't the goal, of course. They were playing in relative calmness (as calm as it can be with five young children among Louis' eight siblings), when Nathan thought it was a good idea to tease little ten-year-old Ren about his favorite childhood blanket.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Nathan," Louis warns when he sees his brother drawing on Ren's blanket. The little boy was sucking his thumb (an awful habit he still hasn't let go of), but when he notices his brother bothering him, he frowns at him and whines. Unfortunately, his whining only makes Nathan tease him even more, smirking and taking off the blanket from Ren's lap.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>Oh no, here we go,</em> Louis thinks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Neeeeeh!!" Ren whimpers. "Stop badgering me!" Louis doesn’t even know where his little brother learned that word. Ren throws a desperate look at Mary, who immediately takes the blanket from Nathan's hands with a glare and gives it back to Ren. The little boy promptly resumes sucking his thumb again, satisfied to have recovered his blanket. Nathan doesn't find it fun, because he only huffs and rolls his eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You'd think that would be the end of it, but no. Louis is in the middle of writing a text to Harry, so he doesn't see it when it happens.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Daniel leans in and whispers something in Ren's ear, and suddenly the little boy grabs a pillow and throws it right at Nathan's face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Everyone freezes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis lifts his eyes from his phone, looking over his siblings with an arched eyebrow. And then everything goes downhill.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ten minutes later and the living room is a total mess, pillows everywhere and two broken glasses on the table. Jeanne almost cuts herself picking a piece of glass, and it's the cue for Mary to be the responsible adult and send everyone upstairs while she, Eliza and Louis clean up the mess left behind.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza and Louis are still giggling though, with the girl throwing one last pillow at Louis who was texting Harry (again). "Can you let go of your phone for one goddamn second, Boo?" Eliza teases him. "Your boyfriend won't go anywhere!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At that, even Mary drops cleaning duty for a second, glancing at Louis with an annoyingly superior smile. "Oh yes, that's right! Louis is enamored.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis huffs a snort, rolling his eyes as he finishes cleaning up the broken glasses. "Bullshit.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It's true," Eliza supports. ”He’s completely smitten with Styles.” She looks at her sister with an fake exasperated look. "You should have seen him when we went to Wisp Resort. I felt like I was third-wheeling.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary’ boisterous laugh resonates between the walls of the living room.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Give me a break!" Louis shoots back, but he can't help the smile forming on his lips. He hides it by turning his back to his sisters, throwing away the broken pieces into the bin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"So what's up with you two?" inquires Mary as soon as he makes the mistake of joining them into the living room again. "Are you two like, flirting? Dating for the summer...?" she inquires, plopping down on the couch. Eliza snuggles with her, and Mary throws an arm around her sister, smiling and waiting for Louis’ reply.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The latter sits in the opposite couch, crossed-legs. He shrugs, a bashful smile on his face. "I don't know yet. We just...” Okay, should he say what happened at their date or are they going to tease him even more? No, no he won't say anything. He knows his sisters.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Thankfully, he’s saved by making any stupid decisions when the front door opens, Tristen and Natasha Tomlinson appearing into the house.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mom, Dad! You're here already,” exclaims Mary in surprise, checking her watch with knitted eyebrows.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yeah, the party wasn't that fun," Tristen mumbles, his face somber. He looks like his favorite soccer team just lost a match.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha rolls her eyes next to her husband. "Quit being a child, Tristen.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What happened, Dad? You seem upset," notes Eliza. He does seem upset. His face is a bit red, he’s visibly scowling and seems quite agitated.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tristen glances at his three kids before shrugging, giving them a small smile. "No big deal.” He kisses his wife on her cheek, waving at his children. "I'm gonna sleep, goodnight kids!” Louis knows their father just wanted to save them the trouble of knowing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary waits for Tristen to disappear upstairs before she turns toward their mother with an inquisitive look. "What happened?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha waves a hand, joining her kids on the couch. She sighs, "Oh, he just had a bit of fuss with Trent Styles.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis sits upright at that, raising an eyebrow in confusion. "Harry's dad? Why? What happened?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His mother waves a dismissive hand again. "You know how men are. They were talking about the Cup of the Town, and I don't know how, but somehow they started discussing the number of kids they have and turned it into a competition... A manhood thing," she adds to Eliza’s puzzled expression. "And now your father made the bet that you guys will win the cup against Trent's kids.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There's a pause, and then Mary speaks. ”Wait, you mean… Dad bet with Louis’ boyfriend’s dad that we would smash Louis’ boyfriend’s family at the Cup of the Town?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis huffs, rolling his eyes. Something he has done a few times throughout the evening. “He's not my boyfriend!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary ignores him, sending a gloomy look to their mother. “Mom… We never won the cup the other times we participated.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"There's a first time for everything!" Tristen yells from the stairs.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Natasha widens her eyes, bolting up from the couch as she makes her way upstairs. "Tristen, the kids are asleep,” she whisper-shouts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Louis is left alone with his sisters, with whom he exchanges baffled looks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well,” Mary says slowly. “This is just great.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Elisa shakes her head, looking beyond lost. “But what is this cup thing again?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary sighs. "Every year, during summer, the town organizes a family competition to win some cup. It is fun and all, but I have a feeling this year, it's gonna be...” She searches for the right word, shrugging her shoulders. "Well, definitely less fun. Dad is a competitive guy.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I don't remember much from that contest," Louis confesses with a frown. "I was like, what? Seven years old the last time we came here?" Mary nods. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I was five,” Eliza says, pursing her lips. “I don’t remember anything.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, I was ten, and I remember it perfectly,” Mary retorts with a snort. frowning at whatever memory she is thinking of. “Our bro Warren was competing in that egg thing challenge and...” She scowls. "And that stupid William Styles tripped him.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Is that why you dislike him so much?" Elisa quizzes with a thin smirk, passing a hand through her blonde hair. "Because he stole our victory?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well, he didn't steal it," Mary concedes. "To be honest, we were in a bad position in the ranking, if I recall. But Warren would have gotten the point if not for that idiot.” Mary shakes her head. "He seemed innocent at the time, but now I know better. I will never trust him.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eliza laughs while Louis snorts, reading his sister like a opened book. "Generally, when you start repeating the word ‘idiot’ to describe a guy, it's because deep down you like them.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mary glares at him. "Shut up. And make sure not to be misguided by Harry Styles!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Like you were once fooled?” he retorts, and it gains him a slap on the shoulder.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He doesn’t tell her that it’s too late, that he already fell for Harry Styles.</span>
