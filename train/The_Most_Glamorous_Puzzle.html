      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>So this is gonna be a thing because, as I established in the past, I am complete and utter trash for this pairing, and I just can't stop writing fluff about them.

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Some say that, as long as people remember who you are and how much of an impact you had on their lives, you will never truly die.</p>
<p>And more than anything else, Mettaton wanted to be remembered. He wanted the world to know his name, he wanted to bring that special vicarious excitement into their lives, he wanted to follow his dreams and have people staying up late into the night just to watch his shows... yes, he had family and friends on the snail farm, but who would be interested in that sort of thing? How many snail farmers had a red carpet rolled out for them on a regular basis? Even though his incorporeal form meant he was in no danger of dying anytime soon, he would have gladly chosen being corporeal over being forgotten. For even if he did die for whatever reason, at least he'd be able to go out in a blaze of glory.</p>
<p>Eventually, he did become corporeal, and it was shortly afterwards that he found out that, in spite of his new vulnerability, he truly had become immortal in the eyes of monsterkind. His ratings had reached heights he'd only dreamed of in the past, and the viewer call-ins afterwards made it clear to him: the monsters didn't just love him, they needed him. When you have so many people saying that things wouldn't be the same without you, you most likely won't be forgotten for a very long time. Even his cousin, who would have had every reason to want nothing more to do with him by that point, still cared about him and wanted him around.</p>
<p>That fact alone would have been enough to convince him that people truly loved him, but it really began to shine through when he met Papyrus.</p>
<p>Meeting fans in person always brought joy to Mettaton's heart. Listening to just how tongue-tied they would become in his presence, seeing their faces light up like a Christmas tree at the slightest smile or compliment he would give them... Papyrus had been no exception. Mettaton became very acquainted with the word "wowie" on that day.</p>
<p>However, thanks to their mutual friendships, the two were able to see each other more frequently than most celebrities and fans could see each other. Eventually, the day came when they stopped just being friends of friends and started truly being friends. And then, somewhere along the line, they both decided that being friends wasn't enough.</p>
<p>Whenever they would go out on a date, Papyrus would always do his best to make Mettaton feel important. He would never, ever use this as an excuse to act like no one else was important, though; every employee he interacted with, from the waiters at a nice restaurant to the box-office clerks at the theater, was always treated with the utmost level of courtesy. If their friends and/or family members tagged along, Papyrus would make sure they didn't feel like mere third wheels. When he and Mettaton decided to move in together after being together for so long, Papyrus had even helped the movers carry and assemble the furniture. And then, once the movers had left and everything had been set up and put away, the first thing he did was lie down on the couch with Mettaton as the two watched reruns of the latter's shows, both old and new.</p>
<p>Mettaton's bodies were all built to last, so despite being corporeal now, he most likely didn't have to worry about death for a long, long time.</p>
<p>But he didn't need to contemplate that very often, because when he thought about how much his fans loved him - and especially when he thought about the times he and Papyrus were alone together - he already felt immortal.</p>

      <p>Chapter Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This chapter contains a couple of brief scenes of a character experiencing misophonia, and the anxious feelings that result from it. Please keep this in mind as you read.</p></blockquote>
  </div>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>When you dream of being the coolest person around, it's easy to fall into the trap of caring too much about what others think.</p>
<p>Papyrus was one such person; as much as he and his brother cared about each other, it just wasn't enough. He dreamed of being a hero to many, and then everyone would give him all the friendship and kisses and social-media attention he could ever want.</p>
<p>As such, it wasn't hard to sway his opinions on certain things, depending on what people thought were cool. For example, his best friend Undyne couldn't stand Hotland, so at times, he'd put up a front of agreeing with her. Granted, he still preferred Snowdin, but he couldn't stay completely mad at Hotland; that was where Mettaton, his hero, lived. In addition, there was the matter of his relationship with grease; normally, he claimed to hate it, but whenever Undyne talked about how much she loved it, he would suddenly share the same opinion.</p>
<p>In truth, Papyrus had the idea that, since people loved Undyne and people also loved Mettaton, the best way to win people's hearts was to treat both of them as his main role models. It certainly didn't hurt that he genuinely loved both of them, although one was in a strictly platonic way and the other had yet to meet him at the time.</p>
<p>He felt himself change his opinions yet again when Frisk had arrived underground; Frisk had wanted to be friends with him because of the kind of person he already was, not the kind he was trying to be. The barrier had broken that same day; when everyone moved aboveground, Papyrus resolved to be himself more often, even if he did still admire his role models.</p>
<p>And it ended up being the thing that caused him to catch the attention of the role model he hadn't met yet.</p>
<p>Through the sheer power of being his typical silly, yet kindhearted self, he ended up leaving such a good impression on Mettaton that the star wanted to see him more often after their first meeting. It didn't take much time for the two to develop a strong bond. (Granted, their meetings were initially rather infrequent for several reasons, including their other commitments, but once it solidified, the two were nigh-inseparable.)</p>
<p>That being said, although he had grown as a person since those days underground, Papyrus still had a number of lessons to learn in regards to interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>He learned one such lesson one day when he and Mettaton were hanging out at the latter's house; they were still in the relatively early stages of their friendship at this point. Someone had come over to upgrade Mettaton's cable TV services, and he and Papyrus were sitting on the couch and watching them. Mettaton had brought over some sticky notes and a pen just in case there was anything he needed to remember.</p>
<p>As the cable person worked, occasionally striking up quick conversations with the two, Mettaton had taken to idly tapping his pen on the table.</p>
<p>
  <em>Tap tap tap tap tap...</em>
</p>
<p>Papyrus felt himself wince. That repetitive sound... why was it so jarring? It was just a pen on a table; Mettaton wasn't causing any harm with it. And yet it bothered him; it felt much louder than it actually was.</p>
<p>
  <em>Tap tap tap tap tap...</em>
</p>
<p>His expression tried its hardest not to give away that something was wrong. He couldn't just tell Mettaton to stop... it wasn't a big deal! Again, it was just a pen on a table. As soon as the installation was over, the person would leave, Mettaton wouldn't need to use his pen anymore for the time being, and then Papyrus could just pretend like nothing happened. It was as simple as that!</p>
<p>Soon enough, the person was finishing up, and as they gave Mettaton a card with the password on it, he mercifully stopped tapping and used his pen to write a copy of the password on a sticky note. Papyrus could have almost sighed in relief; if he'd done so, he would have just passed it off as being happy that the upgrade was a success.</p>
<p>Finally, once the person left, Papyrus leaned back in his seat, grateful that this was over.</p>
<p>"Isn't this exciting, darling?" Mettaton's eyes sparkled. "I have so many new channels now!"</p>
<p>"Nyeh heh heh! It certainly is exciting!" Just like that, Papyrus seemed to be comfortable again. "Ooh! Maybe you could get everyone together and have a TV-watching party to celebrate! We could make popcorn!"</p>
<p>Mettaton chuckled. "I will have to keep that in mind. But for now..." He handed Papyrus the remote. "Why don't we give this a little test run? Since you're my guest, you get to choose what to watch."</p>
<p>Papyrus grinned; both Mettaton and Undyne cared very much about being good hosts (and Mettaton already was a good host, in another sense of the word). He hoped that, if Mettaton ever came over to his place, he could be a good host for him too. Back underground, he'd already been a good host for Frisk, so he could probably host Mettaton too if he just tried.</p>
<p>At first, it wasn't a big problem. Papyrus gladly took the remote, turned on the TV, and began searching through the on-screen guide. "Wowie! Look at everything!"</p>
<p>"I know; isn't it thrilling, sweetheart?" As he watched Papyrus scrolling through the guide, he once more began tapping his pen on the table.</p>
<p>
  <em>Tap tap tap tap tap...</em>
</p>
<p>Just then, he noticed the scrolling suddenly pause; since Papyrus wasn't selecting this channel, something had to be up. He looked over. "Is everything all right, Papyrus?"</p>
<p>"Of... of course! Everything is fine!" Spoken while sweating and trembling a bit; Mettaton didn't need his body to have a BS detector built into it, for he already had a quite good one.</p>
<p>"It doesn't look like everything is fine, darling. Please, talk to me."</p>
<p>"I..." Papyrus lowered his arm and took a deep breath, looking at Mettaton as if to pre-emptively apologize for what he was about to say. "I don't like the tapping."</p>
<p>"Oh, this?" Mettaton looked at the pen in his hand, before setting it on the table and leaving it there. "I'm sorry, darling. I won't do it anymore if it bothers you."</p>
<p>Papyrus blinked. It was that easy?</p>
<p>"To be quite honest, you should have told me earlier. I would have gladly stopped then."</p>
<p>"But I didn't want to embarrass you in front of the cable person!" And besides, who was he to tell Mettaton, of all people, what to do - as a guest in the man's house, no less? He may have been the Great Papyrus, but if there was one person he would ever consider to be greater than himself, it was Mettaton.</p>
<p>"That's what whispering is for. Or some other discreet way of telling me."</p>
<p>Although Mettaton wasn't hostile in either tone or body language, Papyrus still wasn't ready to let his guard down. He looked down with a sad sigh. "I didn't want to tell you what to do, either... a good guest doesn't just tell the host what to do!"</p>
<p>"And a good host makes sure his guests are comfortable." He scooted a tiny bit closer, and Papyrus looked up at him as he continued. "If my houseguests don't like something, they have the right to speak up. It's true for Alphys and Blooky and Frisk, and it's also true for you, Papyrus. I wouldn't want to make any of my fans feel unwelcome." His eyes sparkled again. "Especially not when the fan in question has been such a delight to be around."</p>
<p>Papyrus felt a little lightheaded, not just because of the compliment from his hero, but because of the situation in general. He wasn't sure why he'd been expecting a more hostile response from Mettaton; was it his people-pleasing instinct kicking into overdrive? Nevertheless, he smiled. "Thank you, Mettaton. I will remember that from now on!"</p>
<p>As the scrolling resumed, Mettaton smiled as well. When he saw Papyrus' eventual choice for a new channel to watch - the high-definition music video channel - he looked over at him again. "Good choice, darling!"</p>
<p>Papyrus' smile grew wider, his earlier discomfort all but forgotten by now. Truthfully, he'd wanted to see if there was a high-definition version of Delta Rune Network, but he couldn't find it so far. Besides, he was already seeing Mettaton himself in the highest definition possible.</p>
<p>The two watched music videos for a little while, and Papyrus occasionally found himself reflecting on Mettaton's words. From this point on, he would make more of an effort to be honest, even about things that were upsetting him.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even the smallest events can sway people and encourage them to change.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>A scoff. "Oh, great..."</p>
<p>"Nyeh?" Papyrus looked up from his book of sudoku puzzles. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Mettaton sighed, resting one arm on the arm of the couch the two were sitting on, and using his other arm to gesture towards his laptop screen. "Oh, it's just this review of my latest album, darling. The things they're saying about it...!"</p>
<p>Truth be told, Mettaton really didn't like it when his work was criticized. When you're really passionate about something and put all your heart and soul into it, it can really sting to have someone tell you that it has problems. However, he was able to accept that certain types of criticism had their place; as much as he cared about his own ego, he also cared about quality. If someone gently pointed out some sort of technical issue or other objective error, then he could easily find a way to address it for later performances (this was true whether he was making a TV show, an album, or even just performing live).</p>
<p>But when people criticized his work based on purely subjective criteria, such as simply not liking his style, that was a completely different story.</p>
<p>He gently pressed his hand against his forehead. "They're saying it's 'artificial' and 'self-indulgent' and 'pretentious'. Yes, my songs use synthesizers and drum machines and heavy amounts of polish. And your point would be what, darling? Not every song can be just strumming the same three chords on an acoustic guitar!" Realizing what he'd said just as it left his mouth, he took a deep breath and moved his hand to rest on Papyrus' hand. "...No offense, sweetheart."</p>
<p>"It's okay."</p>
<p>With another sigh, Mettaton leaned back. "I'm sorry, beautiful. It's just... if they're going to criticize my work, why don't they focus on the actual problems, if they exist?" Mettaton very often made a point of editing out imperfections, but in the past, there were a few even he couldn't catch until after the fact. "This review is just criticizing me for being me. I've performed in this style for years, and I still headline sold-out shows. So why is it a problem again?"</p>
<p>"I don't consider it a problem." Papyrus gave him a bright smile, his eyelights sparkling with excitement. "You have a really cool style. Whenever I hear your songs, I imagine myself being the coolest skeleton in the world!"</p>
<p>Despite himself, Mettaton chuckled. "Imagine? Darling, you already are!" He leaned over and kissed Papyrus' skull. Papyrus slumped back in his seat with a happy sigh.</p>
<p>With that, Mettaton went back to the review he was reading. There had to be <em>some</em> legitimate criticism in there... right? But all he could find was something that made him scoff again and roll his eyes.</p>
<p>"And now they're calling my work 'soulless'." He rested his chin in his hand. "Oh yes, because I certainly don't perform in this style because <em>I</em> want to. Someone must be forcing me to do it." Suddenly, he thought of something, and looked at Papyrus. "Oh, and I just realized. Apparently it <em>wouldn't</em> be soulless of me to completely change my style just because some critic doesn't like me for who I am. You see the problem, right?"</p>
<p>Papyrus nodded before taking Mettaton's hand. "Unfortunately, some people just act freaking weird sometimes. That's like if someone said, 'Wouldn't the Great Papyrus be even greater if he didn't like puzzles so much?'"</p>
<p>For a brief moment, Mettaton faltered, his voice taking on a more protective tone and his eyes narrowing. "Did someone actually say that to you?"</p>
<p>"No! Don't worry. It was just an example."</p>
<p>Mettaton sighed in relief. "That's good." Trying to imagine Papyrus without puzzles would be like trying to imagine himself with absolutely no desire to perform; was such a thing even possible?</p>
<p>He felt Papyrus gently squeeze his hand, and heard him speak once more. "But anyway, you have so many fans who love you for who you are. They all buy tickets to your shows because they like you and they want to see you performing live. Nobody buys a ticket to see Mettaton because they want to see Not-Mettaton. That doesn't even make any sense!"</p>
<p>"That would be quite bizarre." Mettaton chuckled again. "But I think you're right, darling. What's one negative review compared to the thousands and thousands of humans and monsters who love me?" He set down his laptop on the table and put his arm around Papyrus. "Or the monster who loves me on a personal level?"</p>
<p>Of course, Papyrus couldn't resist returning the hug.</p>
<p>As a performer, Mettaton had to get used to the idea that there would be people who would criticize his work. If they were criticizing actual problems, he would fix them to the best of his ability. But sometimes the critiques were of things that Mettaton honestly couldn't help (at least not without drastically changing his style, which he had no particular desire to do anytime soon). As much as he liked to snark about those types of comments, deep down it sometimes felt like an attack on him as a person; he did put a lot of himself into his work.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the occasional criticisms, he still managed to sell out arenas on a regular basis, Delta Rune Network still received a good amount of ratings, and every post of his on social media brought in a lot of supportive comments from both long-time and newer fans of his.</p>
<p>While part of him would probably never be fully able to take criticism in stride, having support from all his fans - Papyrus included - certainly helped.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>As much as Mettaton loved himself, there was no denying that he had people he cared about. And when he cared about someone, he made sure they knew it. It wasn't always this way, but memories of the old days underground, with all the regrets that came alongside them, made him vow to change his ways after everyone moved to the surface. Therefore, whenever there was a special occasion of some sort, he would always do his best to be there and help make it as lovely as possible, giving thoughtful presents as well if the occasion called for it. Even if he couldn't physically be there because of touring or some other prior commitment, he would still find ways to make up for his absence.</p>
<p>This particular day happened to be Papyrus' birthday, and while Mettaton had celebrated it with him before, this was his first birthday since the two had started living together. As much as Mettaton would have loved to just take him out for the entire day and spoil him in every way he could think of, he knew that the others were going to have a party for him that afternoon, so he would have to improvise a little. Fortunately, he was an actor, and actors are often good at improvising.</p>
<p>When Papyrus first woke up early that morning, Mettaton was still in a deep sleep. There was nothing too unusual about this; as long as his battery still needed to charge, Mettaton could sleep through just about anything (unlike Papyrus, who was a rather light sleeper). As he often did each morning, Papyrus went downstairs to clean things up if they needed it, especially in the kitchen. However, once he made it to the kitchen, he found that everything was spotless. The dishes were all clean and put away, the stovetop was so clean he could eat off of it (even though he would greatly prefer a plate or a bowl), and there wasn't even the slightest hint of a mess anywhere.</p>
<p>Papyrus blinked; he was pretty sure it hadn't been this clean when he went to bed last night, especially since, before he'd gone to bed, Mettaton had insisted that he not do any chores on the grounds that tomorrow was his birthday. And yet, it was all somehow clean, so he wasn't complaining; clean houses were happy houses, after all. Besides, this meant more time lying in bed with Mettaton.</p>
<p>(If someone had told him back in Snowdin that there would be a day where he would actually appreciate having nothing to do but lie in bed, he would have at the very least been deeply confused. And yet, somehow, Mettaton had taught him to appreciate those moments without even consciously trying. The man truly was talented.)</p>
<p>And so, he went back upstairs and returned to his previous place, his skull resting in the crook of Mettaton's arm. Although he wasn't very sleepy at this point, he still found himself appreciating the peace and quiet, to the point of even slipping into a light doze at times.</p>
<p>Quiet moments had a way of making time feel like it had no meaning; by the time the sun fully rose and Mettaton woke up, it both felt like a really long time and no time at all. When Papyrus heard his systems whirring, he was promptly fully awake again.</p>
<p>As soon as Mettaton opened his eyes, he turned his head towards Papyrus and grinned. "Good morning, my lovely birthday boy."</p>
<p>"Good morning, Metta!" In that instant, Papyrus felt more energetic than before, ready to seize the day.</p>
<p>He didn't actually get to do that until several minutes later, but what he got to do instead was certainly a nice alternative. Mettaton held him close and bathed him in a shower of kisses, all while whispering several different compliments and other nice things in his non-existent ear. Papyrus could have been walking on air; the day had barely started, and Mettaton was already making him feel like the most precious person in the world.</p>
<p>Eventually, Mettaton sat up. "Have I got a surprise for you this morning, beautiful."</p>
<p>"Nyeh?" Everything about Papyrus was silently saying to Mettaton, <em>tell me more.</em></p>
<p>But Mettaton, as previously established, was an actor, and aside from being good at improvisation, actors also know the importance of keeping their audiences in suspense. "You'll get to find out after breakfast. Trust me, darling, you'll love it."</p>
<p>Papyrus frowned. "But if you're saying I'll love it, I don't know if I can wait that long!"</p>
<p>"I know you can, sweetheart." With a grin, Mettaton leaned down. "Especially since I'm going to be making your favorite oatmeal for you."</p>
<p>Just like that, Papyrus' face lit back up. "Wowie! You had me at oatmeal."</p>
<p>With that, the two proceeded to prepare for the day. Mettaton got ready as quickly and efficiently as possible so he could head straight to the kitchen and make breakfast. When Papyrus joined him downstairs, he was overjoyed to find that a big bowl of dinosaur-egg oatmeal was indeed waiting for him, and he wasted no time in chowing down. Little things like this certainly made it easier to wait.</p>
<p>Once breakfast was finished, Mettaton had him watch TV in the front room while he went elsewhere in the house to set things up. Not wanting to turn on Delta Rune Network when he might have to turn off the TV at any time, Papyrus instead settled for watching the weather forecast channel. There was something oddly compelling about watching the predicted weather patterns for the next several days, all while sedate pop and rock songs played in the background.</p>
<p>Finally, after a while, Mettaton re-entered the room, his voice a joyful sing-song. "Papyrus, darling, the limo's here!"</p>
<p>"Limo?" Papyrus switched off the TV, looking confused.</p>
<p>"Of course!" As Mettaton led him to the door, he continued explaining. "We're going to be going for a little drive. I can't tell you where we're going because that's the surprise, but as I said before, I know you'll love it."</p>
<p>Although still puzzled somewhat, Papyrus wasn't worried. Mettaton had never let him down before, and he had no reason to start now - especially not on Papyrus' birthday.</p>
<p>The two entered the back of the limo, and before long, they were on the road. Papyrus couldn't help but notice that the route they were taking happened to pass by some of his favorite places, including the historical district, the local lake, and Mt. Ebbot National Park. Mettaton, meanwhile, couldn't decide whether to watch the sights or to watch Papyrus' reactions to the sights; all he knew was that he needed to keep at least one eye on the surroundings, so he'd know when they were almost there.</p>
<p>Eventually, he squeezed Papyrus' hand. "We're almost there, sweetheart. Look down, and wait until I say to look back up."</p>
<p>"All right!" Papyrus looked down at the floor of the limo; it was rather pristine, with the uniform color only broken by the presence of its passengers' boot-clad feet. "Nyeh heh heh! I'm very good at studying the floor! If there's a test on the floor, I know I'll get the top score! ...Hey, that rhymed!"</p>
<p>Mettaton grinned at his boyfriend's enthusiasm. Eventually, when the car made it to a stop and he verified that this was his destination, he opened the door. "We're here! Keep looking down for a little bit longer, all right?"</p>
<p>As they left the car and walked up to the place, Papyrus kept looking down. As much as the anticipation was threatening to wreck him at this point, he kept reminding himself that he could just watch Mettaton's pink stiletto boots. When your partner has legs as amazing as those, it's hard not to get distracted sometimes.</p>
<p>And then, finally, those boots stopped in their tracks. "You can look up now, beautiful."</p>
<p>Papyrus looked up, saw the signage, and gasped. For he and Mettaton were standing in front of...</p>
<p>"A car museum?!"</p>
<p>Mettaton kissed Papyrus' forehead. "I knew you'd love it."</p>
<p>With an excited laugh, Papyrus pulled Mettaton close in a hug. "Wowie! Thank you, Mettaton! This is amazing!"</p>
<p>The pair walked into the museum, and after Mettaton paid for their admission, Papyrus gladly led the way; the expression on his face could best be compared to that of a kid in a candy store. There were lots of rare and unique cars, both old and new, on display. Rustic ones, luxurious ones, streamlined ones, aerodynamic ones, iconic ones, ones that never stood a chance in the market... Papyrus gleefully read the information plaques next to each one, and whenever he happened upon a fact that he found especially interesting, he would tell Mettaton about it, making sure to put the more technical details in terminology that Mettaton (who, like most of their friends, didn't know quite as much about cars as Papyrus did) would easily comprehend.</p>
<p>Mettaton himself listened with rapt attention. He loved hearing Papyrus talk about topics he was passionate about (it didn't hurt that he himself was often one of those topics), since Papyrus' enthusiasm just couldn't be extinguished. (And if anyone ever tried, Mettaton would not be pleased.) At this moment, Papyrus was sharing his love of something with the man he loved - and he was doing so on his birthday! If joy could be bottled and sold, Papyrus would have been a great source of it right now.</p>
<p>Papyrus checked the museum map and grinned. "It says there are more luxury cars in the next room!"</p>
<p>"Ooh! Then what are we waiting for, darling?" Once more, Mettaton let Papyrus show him around.</p>
<p>Ever since becoming close to Papyrus, Mettaton found himself gaining a new appreciation for the automotive industry every now and then. Today was no exception.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>When Mettaton had first learned that Papyrus' dream job involved working hands-on with cars, he had admittedly been quite confused. In human culture, jobs that involved manual labor (blue-collar jobs, as he'd heard them being called) were often considered less than ideal. Many humans, as well as some monsters, would have preferred working like Mettaton, whose line of work was centered around creatively expressing himself.</p>
<p>However, Papyrus honestly loved his job. From his point of view, what could be better than a job where he got to help people, work with cars, solve puzzles, and get a paycheck for all of it afterwards? Besides, as long as the world had cars, it would always need people to help fix those cars when needed, so what better choice for a mechanic than someone who actually wanted to fix cars?</p>
<p>Mettaton didn't quite realize just how much Papyrus had loved his job until one evening sometime after the two had become friends.</p>
<p>He was sitting in Alphys' car as she drove herself and Mettaton home. The two had been asked to appear at a prestigious university so Alphys could do a presentation for the engineering students. Neither of them could complain much at all; the presentation helped Alphys feel more confident in herself, and Mettaton was not one to pass up an opportunity to be in the spotlight.</p>
<p>However, this university was all the way over in the next town, and as such, it was quite a drive to and from there.</p>
<p>Mettaton had decided to make the best of it, though; while Alphys kept her eyes on the road, he paid attention to all the sights and sounds. The dark clouds against the orange sky, the anime-themed playlist that Alphys had put on, the tall trees occasionally separated by billboards showing how many miles it was until the next rest stop, the strange grinding sound coming from the car...</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>"Alphys, darling, where is that noise coming from?"</p>
<p>Alphys gulped. "I... I don't know! The car isn't supposed to make that noise... let me pull over."</p>
<p>After pulling over on the side of the road, Alphys got out of the car and looked around. Mettaton waited inside until he noticed Alphys opening the passenger-side door next to him.</p>
<p>"One of the tires is flat," she said.</p>
<p>When Mettaton got out of the car and saw that one of the tires was indeed quite deflated, he sighed. "How lovely... well, should I call a tow truck?"</p>
<p>"M-maybe we could see if one of the others could help first?" Alphys was sweating a bit, wishing she knew how to change a tire (her only point of reference, the wheel on Mettaton's box form, was quite different from a car tire). "Undyne's at wrestling school right now, but... maybe someone else can help us?"</p>
<p>"I certainly hope so." Mettaton didn't want to have to charge all the way out here; even if the tire was replaced in the interim, would the car battery still hold up in the morning?</p>
<p>He took out his phone, and while unlocking it, noticed that Papyrus had sent him a text message.</p>
<p>
  <em>I HOPE THE PRESENTATION WENT WELL!!!</em>
</p>
<p>Mettaton bit back the urge to chuckle a little; he wasn't sure why Papyrus sent his text messages in all-caps and with all that punctuation, but since he still used proper spelling and grammar, it perhaps wasn't too much of an issue. He began typing out a reply.</p>
<p><em>The presentation did indeed go well. However, Alphys and I have a flat tire...</em> He spent the rest of the text message describing where they were.</p>
<p>It didn't take long at all for Papyrus to reply: <em>OH NO!!! WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO COME OVER AND HELP YOU???</em></p>
<p>
  <em>We would both appreciate that, as much as I would hate to interrupt your day off.<br/></em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>THE GREAT PAPYRUS NEVER TAKES DAYS OFF FROM HELPING HIS FRIENDS!!! I'LL BE RIGHT OVER!!!</em>
</p>
<p>As soon as he saw that message, Mettaton found himself saying, "Well, that takes care of that."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Alphys looked up from her own phone.</p>
<p>"Papyrus is going to come over and help us change the tire."</p>
<p>Alphys smiled. "That's good... then we'll just have to go to a repair shop. If they're still open at this hour, I mean." If not, she could always store the car in her garage until the next day.</p>
<p>While they waited, the two kept themselves busy in different ways. Alphys played a game on her phone, and Mettaton quietly sang different songs to himself, occasionally checking his own phone to see if Papyrus had left him any more messages.</p>
<p>By the time Papyrus himself finally pulled over nearby in his bright red convertible, Alphys was nearly fully absorbed in her game, and Mettaton was bobbing his head to the beat of the song he was singing at the moment.</p>
<p>"<em>She's a killer queen, gunpowder, gelatine, dynamite with a laser beam, guaranteed to blow your mind...</em>"</p>
<p>Just then, Mettaton heard that high tenor join in: "<em>Anytime...!</em>"</p>
<p>Both he and Alphys looked up (the latter yelping a little) and saw the familiar grin of their tall, skeletal friend.</p>
<p>"Wowie! I didn't know we were also having a sing-along! I should have brought my guitar."</p>
<p>Mettaton chuckled. "Thank you so much for coming over, darling. What would we do without you?"</p>
<p>"Well, technically, you could do lots of things, but if something's worth doing, it's worth doing with the Great Papyrus! Now, let's see..." He walked around, looking at the tires, before coming across the problem tire. "Oh my god! That tire certainly is flat! But fear not, for I, Papyrus, have come prepared, as I always do! Do you have a spare tire? I brought one in case you don't!"</p>
<p>"W-we do, but thanks," Alphys said.</p>
<p>"Nyeh heh heh! Let's not waste any time, then!" Papyrus went to retrieve some tools from his car while Alphys opened the trunk to get the spare tire. Mettaton, having no experience with fixing cars, decided to just stand nearby and watch.</p>
<p>Papyrus came over with his tools and, as he began raising the car with a jack, decided to strike up a conversation. "I've heard from an incredibly reliable - and beautiful - source that the presentation went well!"</p>
<p>While Mettaton grinned, Alphys nodded. "They were all very interested in seeing what the future of cybernetics could be. Some of them said that, if I could make an entire body for Mettaton, I could possibly look into developing prosthetic limbs and maybe even other things." She briefly thought to herself; maybe, if the prosthetics worked with monster bodies, she could replace Undyne's missing eye?</p>
<p>"I'm sure you can do it if you just try!" Papyrus gave her a friendly smile. "You're a wonderful scientist!"</p>
<p>"R-right..." Alphys looked down, frowning.</p>
<p>Mettaton, having a very good idea of what was on her mind, crouched down to her level. "You'll be able to find a cure someday, sweetheart. We're all on your side. Shyren is, too."</p>
<p>"I'm trying..." She shuddered a little. "I just... don't want to make it worse."</p>
<p>She felt a pair of metal arms surround her. "Think about it this way, darling: you were able to bring monsters back from the dead. If you can develop a cure, you might be able to refine it until you're able to develop a reliable cure for falling down."</p>
<p>"That's if I can make it work, though..." Alphys tapped her claws together.</p>
<p>"And if you can, you will be a hero to monsters everywhere." He smiled. "In a way, you already are."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Since becoming a star, I've become an inspiration to so many. People have told me how much they love seeing me perform, and how much joy it brings to them." He looked her in the eye. "But I never would have become the kind of star I wanted to be if I didn't have a body. And who, exactly, created a body for me?"</p>
<p>"I did..." The wheels in Alphys' mind began turning a little.</p>
<p>"Exactly! It was because of you that I was able to become a star in the first place, instead of just wistfully dreaming of fame on a snail farm. Also..." He briefly stared at his own arm. "Because of you, I have a body that makes me feel like myself. I honestly can't thank you enough for that, darling."</p>
<p>Alphys gently smiled. "I... I still need to make a few adjustments to it, though. Improving the battery life a little, giving you some better waterproofing..."</p>
<p>"Take your time, sweetheart. My body as it is, is already miles beyond what I could have dreamed of."</p>
<p>While they were having this conversation, Papyrus was working quickly and efficiently. He had unscrewed each of the four wheel bolts, switched the flat tire with the spare, and was in the middle of screwing the bolts back in when he decided to put his own two cents in.</p>
<p>"We all believe in you, Dr. Alphys! You have a lot of cool friends, and a really cool fiancee who loves you! And you helped Mettaton make a lot of people really happy - including me!"</p>
<p>"Heh..." Alphys gave a weak smile. As horrible as she still felt about certain events in the past, she tried to remind herself that it was just that - the past - and that all she could do about it was try to improve the future.</p>
<p>Finally, Papyrus replaced the last bolt, and lowered the car until it was ready to return to the road. "There we go! You should be able to get home safely. If not, let me know. I'll pull over every ten miles and check my text messages just in case!"</p>
<p>Alphys adjusted her glasses with a nervous laugh. "You don't have to, because we should be okay... thanks, though."</p>
<p>"But I do have to! It's not safe to check your text messages while driving!" He grinned. "And besides, I just want to make sure my best friend's fiancee and my cool superstar friend get home safely! Because the Great Papyrus always looks out for his friends!"</p>
<p>He punctuated this with a dramatic pose, the wind picking up his scarf for added effect.</p>
<p>"Well, I should be going. I have to make sure Sans picks up his socks. Have a good night!" Papyrus put his things back in his car and drove off after the others thanked him and said goodbye.</p>
<p>As he watched him drive away, Mettaton smiled at Alphys. "Isn't he just delightful?"</p>
<p>"Yeah..." Admittedly, Alphys didn't know Papyrus as well as Undyne did, though she had spent one-on-one time with him before (a lot of it being spent jogging). As she looked back up at Mettaton, she couldn't help but notice the wistful look on her friend's face. "So, uh, should we go now?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Oh, right." Mettaton wasn't quite sure what had come over him. Regardless, he re-entered the car with Alphys, and the two headed off into the night.</p>
<p>Although Mettaton himself would most likely never want to take on another job that wouldn't let him creatively express himself (the snail farm had given him more than enough of that for a long while), it was thanks to people like Alphys and Papyrus that he was gaining an appreciation for people who did hands-on, technical jobs. After all, somebody had to do those jobs, and what better choice than people who were passionate about them?</p>

  <p>"Papyrus?" Mettaton looked over at the very morose skeleton sitting next to him in the limo. "What's wrong?"</p><p>"Nyeh!" Papyrus looked up, about to say that nothing was wrong, before deciding to change his phrasing. "It's... it's no big deal!"</p><p>He could feel Mettaton gently take his hand. "If it's not a big deal, then why do you look like the cable went out just as one of my shows was getting to the especially thrilling part? Did you not like something we did today?"</p><p>Mettaton and Papyrus had spent pretty much the entire day out, doing all sorts of fun things together. They had gone to the local roller rink to start, and despite neither being an expert at rollerskating quite yet (Mettaton didn't even have an edge, because having wheels on two feet is different from having one wheel coming from the center of your lower body), they still had quite a lot of fun. Next was a little shopping spree where they each picked up some new clothes, along with a few other trinkets; at some stores, they just ended up window-shopping, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. By the time they were done, the sun was beginning to set, so they found a scenic place and watched the sunset together. Finally, once evening fell, they had a nice dinner at a monster-friendly steakhouse (according to Mettaton, their filet mignon was to die for). And now, they were heading to their respective homes in the same limo that had driven them everywhere that day.</p><p>"No, Mettaton, I loved everything we did today! It was an amazing date, and we didn't even need to consult the handbook for it!" He looked down again. "And... that's why I'm sad."</p><p>With a slight tilt of the head, Mettaton gave Papyrus a quizzical look. "Because of the handbook, or...?"</p><p>Papyrus shook his head. With a pained expression in his eye sockets, he looked into Mettaton's eyes. "You see... I'm not ready for it to be over yet!"</p><p>"Oh..." Mettaton honestly couldn't blame Papyrus; who wouldn't want to spend more time with him? As he had another thought, he leaned down. "Would you like a hug, sweetheart?"</p><p>With a slightly tearful nod, Papyrus wrapped his arms around Mettaton, who responded in kind while gently whispering to him.</p><p>"If it makes you feel any better, Papyrus... I'm not ready for tonight to be over, either. The only reason we're going home now is because my battery is getting low, and since I'm filming an episode tomorrow, I need all the battery life I can get." He grinned. "Specifically, I'm filming the latest installment of <em>Escape from Castle MTT</em>."</p><p>Papyrus' expression brightened a little at that. "Wowie... I love that show!" He loved everything Mettaton made, but this particular show, which involved lots of action and puzzles, was an instant classic as far as Papyrus was concerned.</p><p>Mettaton nodded. "And when we finish the new season, you'll be able to see the new puzzles we came up with. Isn't that exciting?"</p><p>"Yes..." The expression on Papyrus' face was still rather bittersweet.</p><p>Noticing this gave Mettaton another idea. "Hmm... you know, darling, if you're still sad, you could always think of the time between this date and the next one as time to come up with new things for us to do. Many of the best ideas are created during downtime, after all."</p><p>"Oh?" Papyrus could feel a good chunk of his sadness begin to evaporate.</p><p>With another nod, Mettaton leaned back and took Papyrus' hand again. "Why don't you spend some time thinking up some ideas for our next date? Once you have a list, let me know." He couldn't resist a grin. "Think you're up to the challenge, beautiful?"</p><p>Papyrus felt a new resolve in his heart. "Of course! The Great Papyrus never backs down from challenges!"</p><p>Even when the limo pulled up in front of his house and he gave a slight frown as he grabbed his things, all it took for him to cheer up was Mettaton giving him a kiss and saying, "I can't wait to hear what you come up with." And thus, after bidding him farewell for the night, Papyrus headed home with a spring in his step, joyfully humming.</p><p>Although this date may have ended too soon, he and Mettaton still made a lot of good memories. And Papyrus' mind was already beginning to form ideas for next time so that, by the time it eventually did roll around, he would make Mettaton proud.</p>

  <div class="meta group">
    <h2 class="heading">Speak</h2>

  
  </div>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Without a doubt, one of Papyrus' favorite sounds was the sound of Mettaton's voice. The star spoke in a rich baritone, with a slight mechanical edge due to the nature of his body (the mechanical edge wasn't quite as pronounced in his EX form as it was in his rectangular form, but it was still there). Something about this voice felt compelling to Papyrus; the phrase "smooth like butter" may have been a cliche way of describing it, but it fit so well. There were many nights where Papyrus would just put on one of Mettaton's audiobooks and let that honeyed voice carry him away to many glamorous worlds. Sometimes he would even close his eyes and imagine that Mettaton was right there with him, reciting the words in his room.</p>
<p>Mettaton's voice was very expressive, too; it came with him being an actor at heart. He had a way of incorporating subtle nuances into his voice to portray different characters and express different emotions. Whether he was reading a poem, a story in prose, a script, or anything else, he certainly knew how to make it come to life.</p>
<p>When the two met each other, and especially when the meetings became more frequent, Mettaton ended up familiarizing himself with Papyrus' voice, as well. As soon as Papyrus opened his mouth for the first time around Mettaton, the voice that came out reminded Mettaton somewhat of the supervillain in one of the Saturday morning cartoons (even though, as he quickly discovered, Papyrus was far too kindhearted to be anyone's villain). It was a high, excitable tenor that, most of the time, seemed to be several decibels higher than necessary. Papyrus' voice wasn't subtle about anything, either; if he felt a certain way, his tone would make sure the others knew it.</p>
<p>And yet, something about this voice was endearing instead of grating. Maybe it was because the words being spoken never came from a place of genuine malice; sure, Papyrus would sometimes get frustrated with others (particularly his brother and a small, white dog), but he never wished ill on them. Or maybe it had to do with just how encouraging Papyrus was towards everyone; he believed in them even when they didn't believe in themselves, saying that they just needed some support from "their cool friend, the Great Papyrus".</p>
<p>(Part of it might have also been because Papyrus liked to spend his time with Mettaton talking about his favorite Mettaton Moments; he had quite a large list of specific things, and Mettaton always loved hearing his fans describe what they liked about him.)</p>
<p>As Mettaton learned from Sans one day, Papyrus also liked having bedtime stories read to him. However, since moving to the surface, he would also come up with some stories of his own to help cheer up his friends and family when he noticed they were feeling down. His first story, told to cheer up Sans, was about two cool skeleton brothers going to the moon; from there, he seemed to come up with stories for each of his other companions. Mettaton would never forget the one that cast him as a king, Papyrus as his guardsman, and some of their friends and family as his court; it involved Frisk traveling from the Dreemurrlands and partaking in Mettaton's three trials in order to forge an alliance between the two nations. Although he didn't have as much acting experience as Mettaton, Papyrus still put an effort into telling his tales; he did voices for each of the characters, and even though he made himself appear cool in his stories, he made everyone else cool as well.</p>
<p>Of course, Papyrus' voice was also a welcome sound whenever Mettaton was upset about life. Whenever one of his shows went wrong, or he got a negative review, or even when it just seemed to be "one of those days", Papyrus would be there for him. Given just how boisterous he could be, it was sometimes such a surprise to hear Papyrus speaking in gentle tones. And even though Papyrus' advice bordered on the generic sometimes, and even though he would still put himself over now and then, he was so sincere in his desire to help Mettaton feel better that Mettaton really couldn't fault him very much.</p>
<p>In fact, Papyrus' unremitting kindness ended up playing a big role in Mettaton falling for him. And things only got better from there.</p>
<p>It was just a few nights after they'd moved in together; there was a loud thunderstorm outside, which Papyrus still wasn't quite used to (though not many of the other monsters were quite used to it, either; Undyne was the only one who didn't seem to be afraid). Although he didn't need to sleep quite as much as their friends did, he still needed to sleep, which the thunderstorm wasn't letting him do.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mettaton knew exactly what would cheer him up: a bedtime story. Although Papyrus remained wide awake until the story was done (not wanting to miss any part of it), he could feel his fear and tension float away more and more with each word Mettaton spoke.</p>
<p>Besides, this time around, he didn't need to close his eyes and imagine anything. Mettaton was right there, in his room, reading the story just for him.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, you don't notice a sound is there until it stops. It's quiet background noise that can easily trick you into thinking things are silent, but when the noise isn't there anymore, <em>then</em> it feels silent. Papyrus was familiar with more than a few of these noises; they included chirping crickets, the gentle drones of a computer tower, and the whirring of Mettaton's systems.</p>
<p>Whenever Mettaton was awake, his soul casing would produce a very faint hum, inaudible unless he was in a very quiet room. At times of high emotion, this hum would grow louder, no doubt driven by his internal cooling systems. Every night, a few minutes after he'd plug himself in to charge, he would enter sleep mode and it would fall silent until the next morning. Although his body would be completely still until he woke up, his soul still glowed from within its casing. Papyrus had to get used to that pink light not being there whenever Mettaton was on a long tour; fortunately, a strong skeleton like him had some good coping mechanisms. A good number of them involved turning on one of Mettaton's many works and imagining that he was there.</p>
<p>And when Papyrus was feeling agitated for whatever reason, Mettaton would invite him to cuddle with him, as he often liked to do in other situations. If things had been particularly stressful, then if their positions allowed, Papyrus would rest his skull against Mettaton's soul casing and just close his eyes. That quiet, gentle whirring, together with the pink glow and the warmth from the metal and silicone... it was really all that Papyrus needed to wind down.</p>
<p>But as enjoyable as it was, he didn't like resting his skull near Mettaton's soul for that reason alone; he had another, more personal reason.</p>
<p>While it was commonly believed that skeleton souls were located in the ribcage, to match the biology of other creatures, this wasn't quite the case. Skeletons did have a vital magical organ in their ribcages, but it was more of a regulator for their magic reserves. Their actual souls were located in their skulls, the safest part of a skeleton's body.</p>
<p>Thus, whenever Papyrus let his skull rest that close to Mettaton, it was a way of silently telling him "I know my soul is safe with you". And, of course, Mettaton's soul would in turn be safe with him.</p>
<p>Papyrus was a very excitable skeleton, and he certainly had nothing against loud noises; the activities he and Undyne would partake in counted as proof of that. But sometimes, the only sound he needed was the gentle hum of Mettaton's systems; just enough white noise to break the silence without disrupting his thoughts.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>As part of living on the surface, monsters of course had to learn to deal with weather. The weather had its good points: warm days where the sun was shining, the soothing sounds of a rainy day, the fun activities to partake in whenever snowflakes drifted down and blanketed the ground. However, any type of weather could be a double-edged sword; the sunny days could lead to a heat wave, the rain could end up flooding some places, and there could be so much snow that people couldn't even leave their houses.</p>
<p>Mettaton and Papyrus, as well as all their friends and family members, found themselves caught in the latter situation one winter's day.</p>
<p>When Mettaton woke up that morning, he checked his phone to see what his friends, family, and fans were up to, as he often liked to do every day. On one of his social media apps, he noticed that Alphys had left a post saying that the snow was so thick that she and Undyne couldn't leave their house, so the two were probably just going to stay in and watch anime all day. Undyne herself had also posted about it, with the far more blunt message of "<em>This weather SUUUUUUCKS!!!</em>" Several other people he knew personally - including Sans, Napstablook, Mad Dummy, and Frisk - had left their own posts regarding how thick the snow was.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity as well as concern, Mettaton decided to look out of the bedroom window. There was, indeed, a very thick blanket of snow on the ground, covering the yards and the road, and more flakes just kept drifting down. He and Papyrus lived on a rather quiet street, so he didn't expect to see anyone driving around. Then again, who <em>could</em> drive around in a blizzard like this?</p>
<p>Suddenly, an unsettled feeling took root in his soul. Papyrus hadn't tried to go to work today... had he?</p>
<p>Fortunately, when he headed downstairs and heard the TV from the front room, those worries easily disappeared. Heading into the front room, he noticed Papyrus on the couch, a thick blanket keeping him warm as he watched the latest news about the weather.</p>
<p>Papyrus looked over at him. "Good morning, Mettaton. If you're wondering why I'm not at work, it's because there's a horrible snowstorm outside."</p>
<p>Mettaton nodded. "I noticed. It looks positively dreadful outside, and our friends are saying they can't even leave their homes." He glanced at the couch. "Is there room under that blanket?"</p>
<p>"Of course!" Papyrus shuffled a bit to allow Mettaton to lie down on the couch with him. Mettaton quietly groaned at just how warm everything was as he lay on the couch, Papyrus resting against him and pulling the blanket back up. "My boss left me a message telling me not to come in to work today because of the weather. There's so much snow that no one can leave!"</p>
<p>"Well, we'll just have to stay indoors, won't we, darling?" Mettaton's hand took hold of one of Papyrus' hands, the thumb gently stroking it up top, while Mettaton himself grinned.</p>
<p>"Nyeh! It'll be just like the holiday season!" Papyrus frowned. "Except we've already celebrated Christmas and New Year's, and it's not Valentine's Day yet..."</p>
<p>He felt a smooch to the top of his skull. "Darling, as far as I'm concerned, every day I spend with you is Valentine's Day."</p>
<p>Papyrus felt orange magic gather on his face. "W-wowie..."</p>
<p>For several long minutes, they lay there beneath the warm blanket, Mettaton continuing to stroke Papyrus' hand as the two listened to the weather updates. If the snow hadn't trapped them indoors, they would have loved to help their friends and neighbors if they needed it; being a robot and a skeleton, they were less susceptible to extreme temperatures. However, the roads would still be rather slippery, which provided its own set of dangers that they would have had to worry about. And they hoped that, if the power went out, it wouldn't be out for too long; when one partner literally needs to recharge every night by plugging himself into a wall, power outages quickly become something that is very much not appreciated.</p>
<p>With a longing sigh, Papyrus squeezed Mettaton's hand a little. "I wish the snow would stop being unreasonable, so we could go outside again. Snowy days are my favorite; they remind me of Snowdin."</p>
<p>"I can imagine." Although Mettaton never really had much of a personal attachment to Snowdin - only really starting to appreciate it when he'd learned that his boyfriend used to live there - he couldn't blame Papyrus for appreciating things that reminded him of his old home. As much of a prison as the Underground had been back when they were all forced to live there, many monsters still had fond memories of the places where they used to spend their days.</p>
<p>Papyrus grinned. "I still remember this one time when Sans and I made snowmen of ourselves. Well, I made a snowman of myself, at least. Sans just gathered some snow into a pile and wrote his name on it."</p>
<p>"Oh my..." Mettaton began snickering. "He <em>would</em> do something like that, wouldn't he?"</p>
<p>After laughing for a bit, Papyrus thought of another story to tell. "There was another day in which I spent hours playing Ball in the forest. You would have to kick a snowdecahedron into a hole, and the exact manner in which you did it was said to describe who you are as a person. It's like a personality quiz combined with exercise!" His eyelights sparkled. "I most frequently got orange flags, which means I'm very brave. But considering I'm the Great Papyrus, that isn't much of a surprise. Especially since orange is my favorite color."</p>
<p>Mettaton's curiosity was piqued. "Is there a pink flag?"</p>
<p>"If there is, I never saw one. There's a purple one and a red one, though!" Just like that, Papyrus had an idea. "Ooh! Maybe one day, we can go to Snowdin, and you can play Ball and see what you get! And then I can show you all the cool puzzles I made!"</p>
<p>"I'm sure they're amazing," Mettaton said. "It would be lovely to see them for myself."</p>
<p>"Nyeh heh heh! They are amazing! I even made one of them as a tribute to you!"</p>
<p>"Oooh!" Mettaton gave him another kiss. "Tell me more, beautiful."</p>
<p>And so they spent a good deal of time talking about puzzles and Snowdin, all while staying warm from the blizzard outside. Fortunately, after that day, the worst of it was over, and the snow became reasonable again. But even when the weather was horrible, the two certainly knew how to make the best of it.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Next Saturday, huh?" Undyne sipped her coffee.</p>
<p>Alphys nodded. "I think Mettaton's really gonna love the setup. There's gonna be a karaoke machine, and I'm looking into getting some glowsticks, and..."</p>
<p>Papyrus, on the other hand, wasn't paying much attention, instead looking around at the decor of the coffee shop they were all sitting in. It was a fairly modest place, with abstract art hanging on the walls, and yet the sleek, simple furniture gave it a modernist aesthetic. Certainly a good place to go to take one's mind off of things...</p>
<p>"Hey! Earth to Papyrus!"</p>
<p>Or not.</p>
<p>"Nyeh!" Papyrus snapped out of it in an instant; Undyne's voice could wake anyone up. She, Alphys, and Sans were giving him odd looks.</p>
<p>Undyne blinked, briefly staring at Papyrus' cup. "Is the coffee going to your head or something? Usually, whenever we talk about Mettaton, you're all over it. You think his birthday party's gonna be too much, or... what's going on here?"</p>
<p>"Well...!" Papyrus stalled for a second, before sighing and looking down, deciding to tell the truth. "To be perfectly honest, I'm still not sure what I'm going to get for him."</p>
<p>"I... I'm sure you'll think of something wonderful!" While Alphys was usually the one who needed comfort instead of providing it, she still cared very much for her friends.</p>
<p>Gently drumming the tips of his phalanges on the table, Papyrus frowned. "But what, though? He's very rich; if he wants something, he can probably afford it himself." He still remembered how surprised he was when he'd learned that Mettaton lived in a more modest dwelling instead of the giant, highly-decorated mansion he'd imagined.</p>
<p>"Then you just gotta give him something he can't afford, bro." Before Papyrus could ask how he could afford something Mettaton couldn't, Sans continued. "Something you make with your own two hands. It may not be the fanciest stuff in the world, but as long as you put thought into it, he'll love it a ton..."</p>
<p>Papyrus sighed. "Please don't say what I think you're going to say..."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in these situations, Sans was not a good listener. He winked. "A <em>skele-ton</em>."</p>
<p>The palm of Papyrus' hand met his forehead. "Sans! What did I just tell you?"</p>
<p>Sans shrugged. "Beats me. Weren't you listening, either?"</p>
<p>The rest of the meeting at the coffee shop went by rather uneventfully. Papyrus kept thinking about Sans' advice, though, and by the time he and Sans went home, he'd already felt an idea come to him.</p>
<p>He went to his room, opened the case containing his prized acoustic guitar, and gave it a few experimental strums.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Oh my..." Mettaton held the framed pencil drawing of himself that Alphys had given him, studying it from every angle. He'd expected her to be able to render his form very well on paper, given that she had drawn all of his blueprints, but this was something else. The drawing had been carefully constructed, from the line-art to the placement of values, to the point where it almost felt real. It helped that, in the drawing itself, Mettaton was posing dramatically, one leg in the air.</p>
<p>Alphys was sweating a bit. "Do you like it...?"</p>
<p>"It's amazing, darling. I'm definitely going to display this somewhere." His smile was so sincere that Alphys couldn't help but smile back as she listened to him. "This drawing brings out everything that makes me wonderful - and I expected no less from the woman who made my dreams come true."</p>
<p>"Thanks." Alphys couldn't hold back a grin.</p>
<p>"Thank <em>you</em>, Alphys." Mettaton looked out at the assembled party guests. "Well, who would like to give me their gift next?"</p>
<p>Undyne grabbed some more pretzel sticks and gently elbowed Papyrus. "Wanna go, dork? The sooner you do it, the sooner you can stop worrying about it."</p>
<p>"Well, I..." Papyrus thought for a moment. As worried as he was, Undyne had a point... and he had to do it sometime. The Great Papyrus did not just walk out of parties for no good reason! "You're right, Undyne." He looked at Mettaton and raised both his hand and his voice. "Attention, everyone! Would it be all right if I gave my present now?"</p>
<p>"Oh?" Mettaton looked over. "Go right ahead, darling!"</p>
<p>In truth, Mettaton was expecting some kind of object as a gift, which was why it came as such a surprise when Papyrus instead walked up to the stage with his guitar in tow.</p>
<p>Once there, Papyrus took the microphone and cleared his throat. "All right!" Everyone fell silent and turned to face him. "I, the Great Papyrus, have been practicing this for the past several days. I'm sure many of you know this song, and I would like to play it for you. I hope you all like it - especially you, Mettaton!"</p>
<p>He grabbed his guitar, and after making sure it was in the correct tuning, he began to play. Although he was just plucking individual notes for the most part, he had a very determined look on his face, occasionally sneaking glances at his hands. Within the first few notes, everyone recognized the song; it was none other than Mettaton's personal theme song, a motif that showed up in many of his shows.</p>
<p>Mettaton watched silently, admiring Papyrus' dedication. In order to do this, Papyrus had to learn how to play the guitar, and then he either had to figure out how to read sheet music or figure out how to play it by (metaphorical) ear. He wasn't sure how long Papyrus had been playing, but this was clearly something from his heart.</p>
<p>Eventually, Papyrus' strumming switched gears, and he began to play a song that often played in the background of Mettaton's quiz shows. The fingerwork was faster, but the look on Papyrus' face made it clear that he was in "the zone". He was not going to mess this up; this was Mettaton's birthday present (or "activation day", as the man himself called it), and it's not every day that you get to give a birthday present to your personal hero.</p>
<p>After strumming the last notes, he lowered the guitar, taking deep breaths and waiting for a response. Anything could have happened in that moment, and he mentally prepared himself for any possible reaction-</p>
<p>-but he was still surprised when Mettaton stood up and clapped his hands, yelling "Bravo!" It wasn't long for everyone else to start applauding as well.</p>
<p>Papyrus smiled, feeling relief settling over him. <em>Wowie... Mettaton liked my performance!</em> After thanking everyone, he headed back to where he had been sitting.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for Mettaton to approach him. "That was phenomenal! I always love fan interpretations of my work."</p>
<p>"Thank you..." Papyrus made a mental note to thank Sans for the advice; gifts from the heart truly were the best gifts to give someone who could afford all sorts of material possessions.</p>
<p>"Just out of curiosity..." Mettaton gently smiled. "How long have you been playing guitar?"</p>
<p>And now Mettaton wanted to learn more about him? This was almost too good to be true. Nevertheless, Papyrus spoke. "Well, it all started last Christmas..."</p>
<p>While Mettaton had had many activation days before, and would have many more, this was certainly one that neither he nor Papyrus would forget anytime soon.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Quitting</h2>

  
  </div>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Nyeh...!"</p>
<p>Mettaton walked into the den, wondering if Papyrus was okay, and was met with the sight of Papyrus clutching a controller and staring at the screen. By all accounts, he appeared to have just lost whatever it was he'd been playing; Mettaton didn't recognize the game.</p>
<p>"Is everything all right, sweetheart?"</p>
<p>Papyrus gasped and spun around, but his expression softened when he saw it was just Mettaton. "Oh! Hello, Mettaton! Undyne showed me this game the other day, and I decided to get a copy. She said it was very challenging; she was right." He frowned. "I've been trying to complete this level for the past half-hour!"</p>
<p>"Oh my... that definitely sounds challenging." Mettaton thought for a moment. "I've never played this game, so I unfortunately can't give any specific advice."</p>
<p>"It's okay! I still appreciate the thought!" Papyrus turned back towards the screen and decided to give the level another try. Mettaton decided to take a seat nearby and watch; the game certainly looked fast-paced and frantic. The buttons and joysticks clacked as Papyrus tried to complete the level; alas, "tried" ended up being the operative word, for even Mettaton's silent moral support wasn't enough.</p>
<p>As his character was defeated yet again, Papyrus let out a frustrated groan. "I thought I had it that time!"</p>
<p>"You'll get it eventually, darling." Mettaton's hand rested on Papyrus' shoulder. "Maybe if you stepped away from the game for a little while, it'll be easier."</p>
<p>"Step away? No!" Papyrus looked appalled. "The Great Papyrus is not a quitter!"</p>
<p>Mettaton blinked. "I... never said you were a quitter?" The very thought of calling him a name like that was abhorrent to him.</p>
<p>"The act of turning off a game is called quitting, is it not?" Papyrus struck a dramatic pose. "And as the Great Papyrus, the only thing I would like to quit is the act of quitting itself!" Suddenly, even as he continued posing, his expression looked confused. "Wait a minute... if I quit the act of quitting, then I'm still quitting something, so I actually haven't quit the act of quitting. Oh no! I think I caught myself in a paradox!"</p>
<p>"Darling... it's all right." He felt Mettaton gently pull him close with his arm. "Despite what the terminology may be, I personally don't consider it quitting. Instead, I consider it taking a break and coming back to it later." Mettaton looked at him with a smile. "I take breaks whenever I can't think of a good way to advance the plot in one of my shows, or whenever I'm having trouble coming up with song lyrics. It really is helpful; perhaps, if you took a break, you'll have an easier time thinking of a solution."</p>
<p>"Hmm..." Papyrus briefly glanced at the screen again. "I'll give it one more try, and if I lose again, then I'll put it down for a while."</p>
<p>With a nod, Mettaton watched as Papyrus tried the level one more time. He made quite a bit of progress, his phalanges flying across the controller buttons and joysticks, as his character moved along the screen and fought the enemies; he even ended up making it further than he'd done before. Unfortunately, he didn't make it far enough, and ended up losing again.</p>
<p>Sighing, Papyrus switched off the game. "All right... what should we do now?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps we could go for a walk?" Mettaton took Papyrus' hand. "The sun should be setting soon."</p>
<p>Papyrus grinned; he always did like seeing the sunset ever since everyone moved to the surface. And seeing it with Mettaton was even better.</p>
<p>As the two walked outside, hand-in-hand, in the cool evening air, he could already feel his mind begin to clear up. He wasn't sure if he would win when he eventually returned to the game, but he felt like he'd be ready after some downtime.</p>
<p>Mettaton's presence did make for great moral support, after all.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Papyrus was bored.</p>
<p>Out of all his family and friends, it seemed like he was the only one who didn't have anything to do. Undyne was continuing her wrestling training, Alphys was doing some important research in her lab, Sans was helping her with said research, Toriel and Asgore were both working at the school, Frisk was <em>going</em> to school...</p>
<p>And Mettaton was out of town for two weeks, filming some scenes for his latest project.</p>
<p>This left Papyrus all alone in his and Mettaton's home. He wasn't even sure of what to do; he'd already done so many chores that the house was nearly pristine, but he didn't want to just sit around and watch TV. Papyrus wanted to <em>do</em> something. And yet, he wasn't in the mood to play any of the games he owned, and he had just practiced his guitar a little while ago. He couldn't even go to work because it was his weekend.</p>
<p>What was a skeleton like him to do, when even Sans had something to do but he didn't?</p>
<p>He lay on the couch for a little while, staring up at the ceiling and daydreaming of random things. Somehow, as he daydreamed, he got the idea to go for a drive around town. And why not? If he passed by something interesting, he could go inside and see what was there.</p>
<p>With that settled, it didn't take long for him to get his boots on and get into his car. In no time, he was out on the road, looking at all the shops and other sights in town. He always loved looking at everything there was to see; things that humans usually paid no mind were deeply intriguing to him. It came with the territory of not being too many years since the barrier broke.</p>
<p>As he was driving downtown, he caught sight of an interesting sign near the local art museum; they were having an exhibit featuring different paintings from young, up-and-coming artists. Almost immediately, he decided to find the nearest parking garage and check out the museum. It wasn't like he'd had anything better to do. (For some reason, his friend Flowery had always liked to ask that question of him; how could there be anything better to do than spending time with cool friends, though?)</p>
<p>Once he was in the museum itself, he looked around at all the paintings in all the different styles. Watercolors, acrylics, tempera, oil; warm colors, cool colors, monochromatic paintings, grayscale paintings; landscapes, still-life pictures, abstract art, and even some portraits.</p>
<p>It was while looking at the portraits that he felt another idea come to him. Had anyone ever painted Mettaton's portrait before? Not just with computer programs, but with real paints on a canvas? If not, maybe he could be the first one to do so. Maybe, just maybe, he could make one as a welcome-home present!</p>
<p>"You like that painting?"</p>
<p>"Nyeh!" Papyrus jumped a little before turning around and meeting eyes with a boy who couldn't have been older than his late teens or early twenties. He had on a backwards baseball cap, and Papyrus grinned at the sight; those kinds of hats were universal "cool dude" attire, of course. "Yes! It is a very lovely painting! In fact, when I look at it, I'm inspired to make my own!"</p>
<p>"For real?" The boy's jaw dropped. "Cause I'm the one who made that painting!"</p>
<p>"Wowie!" Papyrus looked back at the painting. "I love the use of colors in this painting; they set the mood quite well!" He gave a small, nervous laugh. "I must confess, I am still rather new to this art form. Would it be all right to ask for some advice?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>He paid close attention to the boy's advice; as soon as he left the museum, he'd be a skeleton on a mission.</p>
<hr/>
<p>After a trip to the art supplies store on the way home, Papyrus set down his canvas on the table and began to sketch. He was going to make a portrait of Mettaton in his box form, since he'd already had a lot of experience doodling that form every now and then; besides, he wasn't sure if he could do justice to Mettaton's more intricate EX form unless the man himself was in the room with him as a model. Plus, as someone who'd been a fan of his since the days underground, he felt it was a fitting tribute.</p>
<p>The Mettaton on the canvas was striking a dramatic pose, one hand gripping his microphone, as if to say "It's showtime, darlings!" In fact, just looking at the sketch made his voice echo in Papyrus' thoughts. He hoped that he could paint it well; then again, he was the Great Papyrus, and if he could already do lots of things, there was no reason why he couldn't do one more.</p>
<p>Finally, once the sketch was as good as it was going to get, he prepared for the next phase. Slipping on a smock over the rest of his clothes, he took the canvas to the backyard and set it on an easel he'd set up a little while ago. He made sure he had all his supplies ready, and when he was sure, he squeezed some acrylic paints onto his palette and went to work.</p>
<p>The background came first; it would be red on the top half and beige on the lower half, to mimic a stage setting. Papyrus painted carefully, making sure not to let the paints cross past the lines of his subject; fortunately, the paints were relatively quick to dry. After adding a shadow on the stage, he waited a half-hour for the background to dry (just enough time to watch an episode of one of Mettaton's old shows as a reference) before starting on Mettaton himself. He filled in the main parts of his shiny grey body, making them darker or lighter in some places to account for the light source, and carefully painted in some of the squares on his screen.</p>
<p>By the time he'd finished painting all the squares of one color, the sun was setting and he was getting hungry, so he filled in the wheel's basic coloring before deciding to pack it in for the night.</p>
<p>He was right back at it the next day, though, and for a new painter, he was pretty good at filling in details. The "M" on Mettaton's screen, the little treads on his wheel, the dials on his lower body... all that time spent watching his shows had certainly paid off.</p>
<p>When he was happy with what he'd painted, he dipped a small brush in some black paint, wrote "The Great Papyrus" in one corner along with the date, and stepped back to admire what he'd made. It certainly looked like a lively painting that did justice to the Underground's most famous celebrity.</p>
<p>He hoped the man himself would agree.</p>
<hr/>
<p align="center">
  <strong>Two weeks later...</strong>
</p>
<p align="left">As soon as Papyrus heard the rattling of the doorknob, he rocketed out of his seat and ran up to the door. <em>Is that...?</em><em>!</em></p>
<p align="left">It was like the world heard his thoughts; once the door opened, a boot-clad leg stepped in, quickly followed by the rest of its owner, who struck a pose.</p>
<p align="left">"Ohhh yesss! I have returned!"</p>
<p align="left">"Metta!" Papyrus found himself swept off his feet in a huge hug. "I missed you!"</p>
<p align="left">Mettaton gave his skull a few kisses. "I missed you too, my darling sunflower. We were able to complete the filming as intended, though. The finished product is going to be so lovely!"</p>
<p align="left">Papyrus' eyelights sparkled; he loved seeing Mettaton's newest projects when they came out. "Wowie..."</p>
<p align="left">As Mettaton walked in and Papyrus closed the door, he wondered how long it would take before Mettaton noticed a certain something resting against the far wall.</p>
<p align="left">"Ooh! Did you get a new painting for the house, sweetheart?"</p>
<p align="left">Not long at all, evidently.</p>
<p align="left">Mettaton continued admiring the painting as Papyrus walked up behind him. "This is really lovely! Whoever made this certainly brought out how photogenic my other form is! I don't remember having this commissioned, though..." His gaze trailed towards the signature in the corner, and he froze, feeling his internal fans spin faster than usual. "Er... Papyrus?"</p>
<p align="left">"Yes?"</p>
<p align="left">"Did <em>you</em> make this?" Mettaton looked back to face him. "I ask only because I personally don't know anyone else named 'The Great Papyrus'. Especially not this recently."</p>
<p align="left">With a slightly nervous laugh, Papyrus nodded. "I wanted to make you a welcome-home present worthy of the MTT Brand!"</p>
<p align="left">He felt Mettaton pull him close and plant a long kiss on his forehead. "You've certainly delivered, darling. I would love to hang it up somewhere."</p>
<p align="left">"Nyeh..." Papyrus felt butterflies in his ribcage. Back in the day, he never would have imagined that his Mettaton doodles would eventually come in handy to this degree.</p>
<p align="left">Mettaton looked up. "Mechanics, guitar, poetry, and now painting... I've always wanted to meet a fellow Renaissance man." He grinned. "Especially one so loving and kind-hearted, on top of everything else."</p>
<p align="left">As Mettaton gave him another kiss, Papyrus felt warm inside. What could have been nothing but an incredibly boring day ended up leading to something wonderful.</p>
<p align="left">This was his first serious painting, and he got the idea that maybe it shouldn't be his last.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Given how confident Mettaton was most of the time, it would very often come as a surprise whenever the cracks in that presentation would show. It didn't happen often, but when it did, people knew.</p>
<p>"Oh my god..." Mettaton kept muttering to himself as he obsessively combed his hair in the mirror. His hair was probably already perfect, his makeup was perfect, his suit was perfect - but what if there was one tiny flaw he didn't iron out? What if no one remembered anything about this wedding except for his looks - specifically, the flaws in his looks? Given that people often wrote entire news articles based specifically on what a given celebrity was wearing to a special event...</p>
<p>"You all right, MTT?"</p>
<p>Mettaton yelped and nearly jumped several feet in the air. He turned and saw Sans grinning at him - what was he grinning about? This wasn't funny in the slightest! "Don't sneak up on me like that!"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay!" Sans held up his hands. "I'll find a different way to sneak up on you next time."</p>
<p>He gave a silly grin, hoping to turn Mettaton's frown upside-down; Mettaton was having none of it, though.</p>
<p>"I have no time for jokes, Sans." Mettaton folded his arms. "Everything needs to be perfect!"</p>
<p>Sans blinked, wondering where this quick-tempered Mettaton came from. Usually, if Mettaton was angry, he was more reserved about it. This wasn't even his wedding, and yet he was acting like Groomzilla!</p>
<p>Then again, Mettaton had been in charge of planning it.</p>
<p>"Hey..." Sans walked over and leaned against the vanity. "I'm sure you did a great job at planning everything out. Bet ya Alphys and Undyne are gonna love it."</p>
<p>"What if something goes wrong, though? What if the fountain's pump doesn't work, or the music isn't to their taste, or the colors are all wrong, or...?" He took some deep breaths; while he technically didn't need to breathe, deep breaths still had the calming effect they had for others.</p>
<p>"You ever heard the old saying, 'it's the thought that counts'? I'm pretty sure it applies here." Sans hoped his grinning would lighten the mood. "I mean, even if a few things don't go exactly as planned, it's probably not a big deal. Neither of the girls has gone Bridezilla on us; Undyne's been loud, but just 'cause she's saying 'Hell yeah! We're getting married!' So it doesn't have to be totally perfect."</p>
<p>The deep breaths worked wonders for Mettaton's demeanor; instead of lashing out again, he calmly looked Sans in the eye. "I feel like it has to be perfect, though. Alphys has done so much for me; my dreams became a reality because of her, and so I need to thank her properly." He sadly sighed, looking down. "And back underground... I wasn't always a very good friend to her. So I feel like I need to make up for it all."</p>
<p>"I understand. Believe me, I do." Sans gave a sad sigh of his own, remembering his encounter with Frisk at Mettaton's resort. Now that he knew the kind of person that Frisk was, telling them they would've been killed if not for the promise felt like a crass move on his part. Frisk may have been a child, but they were better at forgiving people than even some adults.</p>
<p>Finally, Sans looked up. "I guess weddings are just one of those things where everyone's afraid something's gonna go wrong, but then it ends up going well in the end. I'll bet you anything that everyone's a little freaked out."</p>
<p>Mettaton gave him a curious look. "Even Papyrus?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sure of it."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sans was right.</p>
<p>In a different room, Papyrus stared at himself in the mirror, adjusting his tie slightly. He hoped he would be able to get through this without a hitch. Weddings were dignified events, after all, and Papyrus was going to be the kind of dignified person this event deserved!</p>
<p>(Apparently, the fact that one of the brides probably wouldn't be that heavily concerned about dignity didn't occur to him.)</p>
<p>Suddenly, he heard the sound of weeping from another corner of the room. He looked and saw Asgore slumped on the seat, tears streaming out of his eyes.</p>
<p>"Asgore?" Papyrus got up and walked over to him. "What's the matter? Why are you crying?"</p>
<p>Taking a ragged breath, Asgore grabbed a tissue and wiped his eyes. "There's nothing wrong. I'm just-" he sighed "-very emotional right now." He looked up. "I still remember like it was yesterday. When Undyne was still small, and she wanted me to teach her how to fight, and we would always drink golden flower tea together... and now she's getting married. She and I aren't formally considered related, but I still think of her as a daughter..."</p>
<p>Papyrus could tell that, even though nothing was wrong, Asgore still needed someone. He rested a hand on the arm of the couch Asgore was sitting on. "She'll never forget you. Just like how she'll never forget me. That's why we were chosen to be her escorts."</p>
<p>Asgore nodded. "I'm just so happy for her..."</p>
<p>Looking him in the eye, Papyrus gave him a gentle smile. "Today is going to be a very good day. I, Papyrus, can assure you of it."</p>
<p>Even in spite of his earlier insecurities, he didn't feel like he was lying.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Monster wedding traditions differed from those of humans in a number of ways, including walking down the aisle. When two monsters had a wedding, they would walk down the aisle at the same time, each escorted by two of the people closest to them (aside from each other).</p>
<p>And so it was that the seven of them - Undyne, Alphys, Papyrus, Asgore, Sans, Mettaton, and flower-kid Frisk - all met up just outside the hall where everyone else had gathered for the event.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the brides were struck speechless when they saw each other. Alphys was already the most beautiful woman in the world to Undyne, but her wearing that white dress put it on a whole new level. Meanwhile, it was weird to see Undyne looking so formal, with makeup on, her hair done up, and even wearing a skirt (even if it was over the long pants she had on). And yet, given the circumstances, it just <em>worked.</em></p>
<p>"I sincerely hope you two like everything," Mettaton said. "I wanted to make it as wonderful as possible for you."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mettaton." Alphys smiled at him.</p>
<p>Undyne nodded. "Even though you and I kinda rub each other the wrong way, I still trust you. I wouldn't have let you plan this wedding otherwise."</p>
<p>Papyrus walked over to him. "Indeed! It will be a very beautiful wedding, designed by a very beautiful celebrity!"</p>
<p>Mettaton couldn't hold back a smile. Why were compliments from Papyrus making him feel so fuzzy inside as of late?</p>
<p>"Hey, this is our wedding, so don't try any funny crap!" Undyne glared at Papyrus and Mettaton. "If you wanna ask each other on a date, then you have the rest of the year to do it!"</p>
<p>The two both spluttered, unsure of what to say to that. They didn't want to ask each other on a date... did they?</p>
<p>Such things were soon forgotten when the main event began. Frisk threw their flower petals onto the aisle floor as Undyne (escorted by Papyrus and Asgore) and Alphys (escorted by Sans and Mettaton) followed. None of the guests in attendance seemed to care that much about the itty-bitty details; they were more focused on the event as a whole, and the joy radiating throughout.</p>
<p>That being said, Mettaton still didn't fully calm down until quite a while later. It wasn't out of stress, though - as he found out during the event, he just got very emotional at weddings.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The thing about dating Mettaton...</p>
<p>Well, there were lots of things Papyrus had to take into account since he was dating Mettaton. One of the biggest, though, was the fact that Mettaton was a bonafide celebrity; this simple fact introduced a host of unique challenges to the whole equation. Sometimes when the two were out in public, someone would want to talk to Mettaton (whether a fan or a reporter) and so they would have to pause what they were doing. Fortunately, many of them would at least pretend to be polite about it (not always, though; Mettaton had to slightly increase the level of security at his performances after an incident where someone managed to sneak into his dressing room). Also, since Mettaton was so famous, Papyrus had started getting some attention of his own just for being so close to him. While a good deal of fans had warmed up to him after seeing just how nice he was to everyone, as well as just how happy he and Mettaton were around each other, there were still some fans who thought Mettaton should be dating them and not him. A few times, some fans had even confronted Papyrus over the whole thing; since Papyrus was still polite even when he figured out what was going on, though, it would end either with the fans giving up on arguing, or with Mettaton himself stepping in and defending Papyrus.</p>
<p>One of the most inevitable challenges, though, was the fact that Mettaton's career often required him to travel. Sometimes it would be for a few days, or a few weeks, or even a few months, but he did have to travel every now and then in order to film scenes in far-off locales, or to stage tours promoting his newest albums, or to participate in special celebrity events that expected him to attend.</p>
<p>And more often than not, Papyrus couldn't go with him. If it was a long trip, then he knew that his boss at the auto repair shop might have some issues with him being away from his job for that long; besides, Papyrus loved his job, and so he wanted to save his vacation time for real vacations. He knew that, even if the trip lasted for just a day or two, Mettaton would have to spend most of it doing work, which wouldn't give much time for them to partake in fun activities.</p>
<p>Because of this, it wasn't unusual for Papyrus to be home by himself every now and then.</p>
<p>It always felt a little weird for him to have the house to himself for an extended period of time. Before he and Mettaton decided to move in together, he had always lived with Sans, whether underground or on the surface. The first time Mettaton went on tour since he and Papyrus started living together was probably the first time Papyrus ever really lived by himself. It took a little getting used to; only making meals for himself, not hearing anyone's voice first thing in the morning, just the general sense of <em>emptiness</em> that came with it all...</p>
<p>He hoped Mettaton wasn't lonely, wherever he currently was. It couldn't have been too lonely for him; just like Papyrus still had the company of Sans and Undyne and everyone else, Mettaton often brought his cousin Napstablook and their friend Shyren with him when he went on tour. That being said, sometimes one specific person can give you things that literally no one else can; because of this, Papyrus often found himself dreaming of Mettaton's return. Judging by some of the things Mettaton would tell him over the phone or on social media, the feeling was mutual.</p>
<p>Papyrus couldn't be too sad about things, though; both he and Mettaton were living their dreams, and he knew Mettaton wouldn't want him to just sit around and feel sad until they reunited. Fortunately, he had a good number of ways to cope with this.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways was to simply leave him a message on social media every day. If Mettaton made a post, he would leave a nice comment related to it; otherwise, he would talk to Mettaton through instant messaging. Sometimes they would actually call each other; whether they were in a video chat or simply having a more old-fashioned phone conversation, hearing each other's voices in real time certainly had a way of helping them feel better.</p>
<p>Another way for Papyrus to deal with the loneliness was to hang out with the other people in his life. If neither he nor Undyne had any work to do, for example, the two would often exercise together, often bringing Alphys into it. Sometimes he would visit Frisk and either help them study or show them some new puzzles he'd found. And, of course, he could always spend time with Sans; as much as he would get annoyed at his brother's apparent lack of effort at certain things, Papyrus really did care about his brother very much.</p>
<p>Partaking in Mettaton's existing works also cheered him up. Sometimes it would be in the form of him putting on one of Mettaton's albums while doing chores, making up his own counterpoints to add onto Mettaton's lead vocals. Other times, he would watch some old videos that he and Mettaton had posted online; it was like a photo album, except with videos (and shared with the world). Still other times, he would switch on Delta Rune Network or one of Mettaton's audiobooks and just lie down, daydreaming of his favorite star.</p>
<p>And, of course, he knew he could always partake in his hobbies. Designing new puzzles and/or partaking in other people's puzzles was just the tip of the iceberg. There were also new recipes to learn; he found that this was actually a very opportune time to learn some recipes, since he would be able to master them in time for Mettaton's return home. For similar reasons, he would take the time to learn new songs on the guitar. He would even write poetry every now and then, letting his feelings for Mettaton spill from his pen onto some paper; in fact, this specific hobby actually came in handy one night.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Mettaton stared at himself in the hotel room mirror and sighed; today had not gone as well as he'd hoped. It seemed like everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong; he and the others were lucky that the performance was still salvagable.</p>
<p>While he continued getting ready to go to sleep, he checked his phone and noticed that Papyrus had sent him something. He smiled; just a little while ago, he'd been venting to Papyrus about how rotten his luck had been. Papyrus certainly knew how to help him feel better, even if they couldn't physically be together at the moment.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, he found that Papyrus had sent him an audio file. Wondering what it could be, he put in some earbuds before sitting on the bed and opening the link. The file started out as silence for a few seconds, before the sound of Papyrus' voice came through. Mettaton gasped at what he was hearing; Papyrus had written another love poem for him, and this file was his reading of it. Papyrus had put in some clear effort, too, enunciating every word and speaking slowly so as to give Mettaton time to digest everything. And the words he was speaking...! Mettaton felt tears coming to his eyes. For all of his bravado and quirkiness, Papyrus certainly knew how to write sincere, heartfelt poetry.</p>
<p>When the recording ended, Mettaton needed a few minutes to calm down, grabbing some tissues and wiping the tears away. Today wasn't a total bust after all, and it was all thanks to the man he loved.</p>
<p>
  <em>In fact...</em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Papyrus looked out the window at the moon shining in the night sky. He knew that somewhere, Mettaton was probably looking at the same moon.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his phone vibrated on the nightstand; it was a notification from Mettaton. Did he like the thing that Papyrus sent him? Papyrus grabbed the phone; he had to know!</p>
<p>Much to his surprise, the only contents of Mettaton's reply were an audio file of his own. It was much smaller in size than the one Papyrus had sent, but that didn't matter. Papyrus opened it, wondering what it contained.</p>
<p>This new file consisted of Mettaton saying one simple sentence: "I love you so much, Papyrus." And that was really all he needed to say.</p>
<p>Papyrus smiled, feeling warmth radiating in his heart. Even if he and Mettaton were on opposite sides of the world, they would always be able to brighten each other's days.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Papyrus would spend his days living life to the fullest, so that when Mettaton did come home, he would have so many stories, experiences, skills, and all sorts of odds and ends to show for it.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Papyrus hadn't meant for the day to take a turn in the direction that it did.</p>
<p>It had all started with him looking at his collection of sexy robot action figures, which caught the attention of the resident sexy robot himself, who had come over for a visit. Mettaton was very curious about Papyrus' collection, as well as amazed at his dedication. In turn, Papyrus told him all about where he got each action figure; there had even been a time when he went through Hotland and all the steam-vent puzzles within so he could pick up one of the rarer ones directly from the MTT Resort.</p>
<p>All was well... but then Papyrus asked the question that changed the tone entirely.</p>
<p>"Do you collect anything?"</p>
<p>At first, Mettaton took the question in stride. He laughed a little and related an old memory from before he had his body. Back in those old days in Waterfall, he'd decided to start a diary collection; he would get a new diary for every entry he made. What he'd never told anyone was one of the real reasons why he started a collection: he'd had trouble turning the pages. The paper in most notebooks was so thin that it would be tough to turn the pages for someone like him; just getting the cover open was far easier.</p>
<p>Papyrus had then asked him if he still had this collection, and from there, Mettaton's demeanor became a little more morose. He admitted that it was still in his old house on the snail farm, and that he wasn't even sure if he had the key anymore.</p>
<p>"It's probably around somewhere! And if not, I could help you get inside; it wouldn't be a ghost crime because it's your own house." Just then, Papyrus had another idea. "Or, maybe we could ask Napstablook--"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>Papyrus gasped and winced, not expecting an outburst like that.</p>
<p>Mettaton took a deep breath. "I'm sorry. What I meant to say was, I don't think that will be necessary. Nobody's maintained that house for years, so we might not even need the key. The lock may have become worn-down."</p>
<p>As Mettaton spoke, Papyrus couldn't help but notice that he seemed rather distant in a way. He was about to say that they didn't have to do this if Mettaton didn't want to.</p>
<p>However, when Mettaton made it clear that he did want to go, Papyrus couldn't say no to that. More than anything, he wanted to be there for the man he cared about.</p>
<hr/>
<p>And so it was that, after a short hike up Mt. Ebbot, the two returned to the Underground once more. They walked across the bare dirt that was once the king's throne room (when everyone moved to the surface, Asgore insisted on taking the flowers with him so he could continue taking care of them) before traveling through the rest of New Home. Since people still liked to visit the Underground every now and then, many things were still maintained, including the elevators.</p>
<p>When one of the elevators landed in the MTT Resort, Mettaton felt a lump in his throat. So many memories came back to him; memories of when he had his big break, memories of how the Underground loved him, memories of when he used his rectangle form on a regular basis since Alphys was still working on his EX body, and even some memories of the incompetent business practices he'd put forth. Thankfully, he had people to help him with all of that now.</p>
<p>The two made their way through Hotland; while the elevators helped a great deal in making the trip easier, they still encountered a steam vent puzzle or two on the way. Papyrus was reluctant to cross those puzzles, even though some extra safety features had since been installed. It was such a surprise to him when Mettaton suddenly switched into his rectangle form, scooped him up into his arms, and flew him over the area. As they passed by Alphys' lab, Mettaton let out a wistful sigh; he would never stop being grateful to her.</p>
<p>
  <em>Never again, at least.</em>
</p>
<p>Once they landed, Mettaton switched back into his EX form, and the two went down to the dock. The riverperson was still there, offering rides to whomever wanted them ("Tra la la. As long as these waterways need traversing, who better to traverse them than someone who's always traversed them?"), and so they asked for a ride to Waterfall. The dock in Waterfall happened to be close to Blook Acres, and Mettaton tried to steel the quivering in his soul.</p>
<p>When the two houses came into view, Papyrus recognized the pink one as the one that he'd once thought belonged to "Happstablook, the happy ghost". He didn't know if that was actually the ghost's name, but he wasn't about to ask; the ghost in question went by Mettaton now, and that was what was important.</p>
<p>Mettaton walked up to the pink house and gave the doorknob an experimental rattle - and promptly gasped when the door opened on its own. He remembered locking it before he'd left for the last time; maybe the lock had become worn-down after all.</p>
<p>Fortunately, when he and Papyrus stepped inside, everything was just as he'd left it. The bed, the poster, the TV and its stand, the rug... and the six diaries on the floor. And, of course, the vast majority of what was in the room was varying shades of pink.</p>
<p>"Wowie..." Papyrus looked around. His hero's old home...</p>
<p>"Oh yes. Pink has always been my favorite color." Mettaton picked up the first of his diaries, hoping that no one tampered with it. Fortunately, the writing inside was still intact, and no one had messed with the pages. He smiled, thinking about how he, Shyren, and Blooky did indeed get to perform together eventually.</p>
<p>But how they came to perform together... he didn't want to face it, but deep down, he knew he had to.</p>
<p>Mettaton went through each of his diaries, making sure none of them were vandalized. None of them were, but Papyrus could have been fooled when he saw Mettaton's expression as he read the last diary. He looked pained, with his hands slightly trembling.</p>
<p>"Mettaton?" Papyrus walked up to him. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>But Mettaton didn't respond. In the process of making sure this diary wasn't tampered with, he'd read this entry to the end. And at the end of it were eight little words.</p>
<p>Those eight horrible words... the ones he'd wished so badly that he could take back. The words that had always haunted him to some degree when he was a rising star underground.</p>
<p>
  <em>Sorry, Blooky. My dreams can't wait for anyone...</em>
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Mettaton?"</p>
<p>In that instant, the book crashed against the ground, and Mettaton collapsed to his knees and just... <em>wept.</em></p>
<p>"Blooky... I'm so, so sorry. I never should've..." Suddenly, frustration erupted like a volcano, and he nearly screamed as he continued. "I should have been there! I should have at least talked to them before I left! How could I have been so awful and... and selfish?"</p>
<p>Papyrus frowned; he'd seen Mettaton lose control of his emotions before, but it was so rare that it still felt like a shock when it did happen. He reached over and gently patted Mettaton on the shoulder, hoping to provide at least some comfort. It didn't seem to have much of an effect, though.</p>
<p>"Blooky and Shyren were always there for me... they always understood. They supported my dreams of being a star one day, they were supportive when I told them I felt more like a <em>he</em> instead of a <em>they</em>, they never mocked my passions or told me that I would probably fail or anything similar." His fist clenched. "And how did I thank them? I left without saying goodbye! I can't believe they still wanted anything to do with me after that. If anyone just walked out of <em>my</em> life without saying goodbye, I'd... I'd..."</p>
<p>He stood up, trudged over to his old bed, and flopped onto it, staring at the ceiling; his voice was now a distant monotone. "All those years we could have spent performing together... one of my shows could have showcased the snail farm and brought in some more business... I thought just leaving would prevent me from feeling guilty about it. I feel like such a coward."</p>
<p>Slowly, Papyrus approached him and gently took hold of his hand. "It's gotten better, though. Napstablook and Shyren have forgiven you, and you're all performing together."</p>
<p>"Who's to say it won't happen again, though?" Mettaton didn't even look him in the eye, instead keeping his eyes on the ceiling. "Even when Alphys and I became friends, she and I stopped being on the best of terms for a while. How can I be sure that I won't abandon them again... or that I won't abandon <em>you?</em>" He sighed. "Honestly... even after hearing all of this, you still want to be here with me? You don't want to just... leave me in disgust?"</p>
<p>"No. I don't want to leave you. Especially not in disgust." Papyrus gently squeezed Mettaton's hand. "Because I can tell that you feel horrible about it, and that you really want to make things right." He gave a gentle smile. "And I know you can do it, Mettaton. All you have to do is try. I believe in you, and I know they do, too."</p>
<p>"Papyrus, I..." Mettaton sat up and gently brought his arms around Papyrus. "Thank you..."</p>
<p>Papyrus returned the gesture, gently rubbing his back. "You're a good person, Metta. Even if you think you aren't. Good people make bad decisions sometimes, but as long as they try to be good, they're not bad people."</p>
<p>As Mettaton listened to Papyrus' words, he wondered how he was so lucky to have someone so wonderful in his life. And some of the guilt in his heart floated away that day.</p>
<p>By the time he gathered up his diaries and returned to the surface with Papyrus, he knew in his heart that, although he couldn't change the past, it wasn't too late to change the future.</p>
<hr/>
<p>That night, after he returned home, Mettaton cracked open his newest diary and began to write.</p>
<p>
  <em>My newest, dearest diary:</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I returned to my old home today for the first time in years so I could retrieve the rest of my collection. I felt horrible when I remembered how I treated Blooky and Shyren in the past, but with the help of Papyrus, I was able to forgive myself a little more.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Blooky, Shyren, Alphys... I will never leave you again. And Papyrus, I will never leave you, period.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>This being my seventh diary is appropriate, since I feel so lucky to have everyone in my life.</em>

  <p>If Papyrus didn't know better, he'd swear that he had to be dreaming. He never would have guessed that there would be a day where Mettaton would bring him along to a party; they'd attended parties together before, but those parties were just for their circle of close friends. And yet, tonight, he was in a nice suit and sitting at a table with Mettaton and some of his associates; the other attendees, sitting at other tables, were some famous actors that Papyrus had heard of before (in most cases), along with a few of Mettaton's friends in the music industry.</p>
<p>This whole party was taking place at an outdoor pavilion, with lights strung up everywhere to contribute to the atmosphere. There was a buffet at one corner of the pavilion, another section full of tables, and yet another section was left empty so people could dance. Of course, there was also a stage up front, and it had a karaoke machine; Napstablook and Shyren were currently up there and singing a song together. Despite both being notoriously shy, they were still having fun on stage.</p>
<p>Papyrus glanced at the other two people currently sitting at the table with him. Mettaton was thoroughly focused on the performance on stage; the other person, an orange mammal monster who insisted his name, "despite what anyone else tries to tell you", was Bryan, was idly bobbing his head to the music and looking slightly more disinterested in everything.</p>
<p>When the song ended and everyone applauded, Napstablook and Shyren went back to sit with the other three.</p>
<p>"I hope you liked it..." Napstablook said, still feeling slightly awkward at being the center of attention.</p>
<p>"That was wonderful, darlings!" Mettaton grabbed his drink and took a long sip.</p>
<p>Shyren gently smiled. "You were right; having someone with you on stage really helps with stage fright." She looked at Napstablook, who gave her a nod.</p>
<p>Mettaton swallowed the last of his drink. "Indeed." After studying his empty glass for a second, he stood up. "Excuse me for a moment while I get a refill."</p>
<p>As he walked off, Bryan slouched in his seat a bit. "This party, man... I can't believe I'm actually having fun here." He still couldn't believe that he voluntarily went to a party with Mettaton, after having spent so much time being treated unfairly by him at the MTT Resort; still, he was bored, and he couldn't say no to an event that had free food. Earlier, he had even gone up to sing karaoke; even though he suspected no one else at his table was into the same kind of music he was into, he'd had enough of having to agree with Mettaton on everything for at least the next several years.</p>
<p>Papyrus smiled. "Anything can be fun if you try and make it fun!"</p>
<p>Bryan sighed. "Oh great, now I'm on the set of one of those kiddie shows..."</p>
<p>While Bryan went back to eating his food, Papyrus decided to look around. Tonight was certainly a lovely night; lots of people having fun, the pavilion being wonderfully decorated, the full moon shining up above in the cloudless sky...</p>
<p>It was while he was looking at the moon that Papyrus suddenly felt the urge to start humming something. He tapped out the rhythm on the table as he stared at the moon, the notes of the song coming naturally to him.</p>
<p>"Got a song stuck in your head?"</p>
<p>Snapping out of the brief trance he was in, Papyrus looked over at Bryan. "Yes, actually. I've heard this song several times before, and I couldn't help but think of it right now. It's a song about dancing in the moonlight. In fact, that's what it's called! Here, I can sing some of it for you."</p>
<hr/>
<p>After grabbing a new glass and pouring some of his preferred drink into it, Mettaton began walking back to the table. On the way, he noticed that the moon was out (and while it was a little tough to see the stars in the sky because of the lights, there were plenty of stars on the ground or at tables). Glancing over at the dance floor, he began wondering if he should go there after finishing this drink. It certainly was a beautiful night to go dancing.</p>
<p>At that moment, he was reminded of a song, and couldn't help but quietly sing it to himself.</p>
<p>"<em>We get it almost every night, when that moon gets big and bright, it's a supernatural delight, everybody was dancing in the moonlight...</em>"</p>
<p>But as he approached the table, he froze, and tried to resist the urge to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Papyrus was also singing, but that wasn't what Mettaton found hilarious; it was the specific song that Papyrus had chosen.</p>
<p>"<em>Everybody's feeling warm and bright, it's such a fine and natural sight, everybody's dancing in the moonlight!</em>"</p>
<p>What were the odds? Mettaton covered his mouth with his free hand, trying to stifle his snickering. Although Papyrus stopped shortly afterwards, he didn't seem to notice that Mettaton was there, and instead continued a conversation with the others at the table.</p>
<p>Once the initial hilarity wore off, Mettaton returned to his seat at the table. "Hello again, darlings!"</p>
<p>"Hello, Mettaton!" Papyrus said. Shyren waved, both Napstablook and Bryan nodded, and Papyrus continued speaking. "We've just been sitting here and talking."</p>
<p>"And getting songs stuck in our heads." Bryan knocked back some of his own drink.</p>
<p>"I couldn't help but notice." With a slightly weird smile, Mettaton looked right at Papyrus. "As a matter of fact, I just so happened to be thinking of the exact same song tonight."</p>
<p>For a few seconds, Papyrus was at a loss for words, before he finally laughed a little. "Wowie! So it is true what they say about great minds!"</p>
<p>Mettaton nodded. "In fact..." He glanced at the stage. "The karaoke stage is empty right now, so how would you feel about singing it with me?"</p>
<p>"Oh my god! That would be amazing!" Although Papyrus felt a few twinges of nervousness, he remembered how Shyren and Napstablook sang together, and this helped remind him of how he, too, could have courage.</p>
<p>As the two headed up on stage, Bryan looked at Napstablook and Shyren and shook his head. "Those two, I swear... they could turn anything into a performance."</p>

  <p>The Great Papyrus would always be the first to tell anyone that he certainly was great. A champion at puzzle-making, a wizard at cooking spaghetti, the greatest Royal Guard member that the actual Royal Guard never hired... he could do it all!</p>
<p>Not everyone was fooled, though. And the person who was least fooled of all was Papyrus himself.</p>
<p>If he was so cool, why didn't everyone want to be his friend? Why didn't Sans want to trust him with some of his deepest secrets? Brothers are supposed to be there for each other, but Sans didn't seem to want Papyrus to know certain things. No matter what Papyrus said, Sans wouldn't budge.</p>
<p>And furthermore, Papyrus acted self-confident all the time. It had to be part of the equation; Mettaton always seemed self-confident, and he had fans crowding around him on a very regular basis, begging for autographs. So why didn't people beg Papyrus for autographs? What was he missing?</p>
<p>It wasn't until quite some time after leaving the Underground that he would not only learn the answer, but learn it from the man himself.</p>
<p>The two were hanging out one day and watching one of Mettaton's old game shows. As always, Papyrus found himself drawn to Mettaton's sheer charisma; even if he was doing nothing but listing the rules of the game, the man commanded attention from everyone just by being himself.</p>
<p>After the show went to commercial, Papyrus let the words slip out of his mouth: "I don't know how you do it."</p>
<p>"What? How I make all those special effects?" Mettaton smirked. "Unfortunately, darling, that's a trade secret. I'd tell you, but then I'd have to invent an MTT-Brand Memory Eraser."</p>
<p>Papyrus, unfortunately, wasn't in the mood for jokes like that; he looked down. "No, Mettaton. What I meant to say was, I don't know how you get everyone to love you so easily." He sadly sighed. "For as long as I can remember, I've been trying to get people to love me and be friends with me. But until we all met Frisk, I only had Sans and Undyne. But you... you were able to get the entire Underground, myself included, to love you! I wish I knew how you did it... unless it's another trade secret. I do not wish to violate protocol regarding trade secrets."</p>
<p>"Oh..." After turning the TV volume down a little bit, he gave Papyrus a friendlier smile. "It's actually quite simple, darling. My fans love me because I love them in return. And I always ensure that one of my biggest fans is myself."</p>
<p>"Nyeh?" Papyrus tilted his head a bit.</p>
<p>"Let me explain, sweetheart." Mettaton leaned back on the couch and looked up. "When I was first starting out, I had to convince the Underground why the name Mettaton was a name they needed to remember. In other words, I had to sell myself to them. But I wouldn't have been able to sell myself to them if I hadn't been able to sell myself to myself first. If I didn't like myself, they probably wouldn't have liked me as much as they did."</p>
<p>"So, in order to get people to like me..." Papyrus began. "I have to like myself?"</p>
<p>"Exactly, beautiful. Be the kind of person you wish you could know personally, and it will be easy for you to love yourself. And then the world will love you!"</p>
<p>"Wowie! Thanks, Mettaton!"</p>
<p>"You're quite welcome." Mettaton stood up and posed dramatically. "This has been <em>Self-Help with a Killer Robot!</em> Tune in next week as we explain seven ways to plan a budget!"</p>
<p>As Papyrus laughed, he also thought about things. Deep down, he'd always had subtle fears that no one would like him, so he often tried so hard to be cool. Part of his irritation at Sans' laziness had to do with both his and Sans' images, in addition to his general concern about Sans' well-being. He also would imitate those whom he considered to already be cool; he believed in them so much.</p>
<p>And yet, thanks to his encounter with Frisk underground, as well as this current encounter with Mettaton, and even just surface life in general, he was really starting to believe in one other person: himself. He had made a lot of great friends on the surface, not just in Frisk's circle, but also at his own job; his coworkers, while initially somewhat apprehensive around him, eventually came to realize that he really was a kindhearted person.</p>
<p>If he felt like he needed to improve himself in some way, he would. But in the meantime, as long as he continued to believe in himself, the day would eventually come where his confident attitude would become who he really was, and not just a front.</p>

  <p>It almost felt like a Christmas fairytale come to life.</p>
<p>Papyrus would have been happy enough going to see Mettaton's newest holiday blockbuster. Whether Mettaton was making movies, TV shows, or music, he always put forth the kind of magic that Papyrus just loved. But tonight, he was going to the premiere of Mettaton's movie. A midnight premiere, no less. Seeing the town all lit up in festive lights while he drove down to the theater felt like pure magic, as did going inside and seeing a crowd of people being surprisingly lively for this hour. And the fact that Mettaton himself not only was in attendance as well, but also that he recognized Papyrus, and was happy to see him? It was as if Papyrus had won the lottery.</p>
<p>As if that weren't enough, Mettaton had also offered to pay for everyone's snacks and drinks, in the spirit of the holidays. Whether it was sodas, candy, slushies, or the traditional popcorn, he paid for it all. (At least one family was especially grateful, since they usually didn't have too much money and had been saving up for this event as a Christmas treat.)</p>
<p>Papyrus waited in line at the concession stand, almost shaking from just how excited he was. Tonight was an incredibly special night, and he was going to commit every little piece of it to his long-term memory... or at least get a headache trying! Many voices in the crowd carried on their conversations; Mettaton's voice was among them, telling people some things about the movie they were going to watch (though he kept the details vague, knowing that the majority of his fans wouldn't want spoilers for Christmas - or whatever they celebrated).</p>
<p>"Hey, mister?"</p>
<p>Feeling someone tap him on the arm, Papyrus turned to look at the little girl standing nearby. "Yes?"</p>
<p>"I'm just wondering. Who's that guy on your shirt?"</p>
<p>Papyrus looked down at the shirt he was wearing; it was a classic Mettaton shirt, featuring Mettaton's old rectangular design. "Oh! This was Mettaton before he had his current body!"</p>
<p>The girl scratched her head. "He was a rectangle?"</p>
<p>With a nod, Papyrus grinned. "A very beautiful rectangle. My favorite rectangle, in fact!" Just then, he thought of something. "Does your TV get Delta Rune Network?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"If it does, you'll be able to see reruns of his old shows!" Papyrus glanced at the line and saw that the person in front of him had just gotten their stuff. "Oh, looks like it's my turn!"</p>
<p>Before long, he stepped forward and placed his order. Mettaton was leaning against the concession stand, and when the time came to pay, he stepped in and took care of it.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mettaton!"</p>
<p>"You're very welcome, Papyrus." Papyrus' eyes twinkled; hearing Mettaton say his name was simply unreal. Mettaton smiled at him. "I think you're really going to like one scene in this movie; it involves puzzles."</p>
<p>"Wowie!" Papyrus could feel his magic flutter in his ribcage. "Honestly, I think I'm going to like every scene in this movie, but a scene with puzzles? This is going to be the greatest movie premiere I've ever been to!" He gave a slightly embarrassed laugh. "Especially because it's the only one I've ever been to."</p>
<p>Mettaton brought his hands to his mouth. "Oh my! We'll have to fix that one of these days!"</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, the concession stand employee gave Papyrus his food, as well as an empty drink cup for him to fill. As Papyrus went to do that, he saw Mettaton give him one more smile. Papyrus could have sworn that this was just a dream, and yet, it felt way too real.</p>
<p>The movie hadn't even started yet, but Papyrus could already tell that this was going to be one of the greatest nights of his life.</p>
<p>And going by just how friendly he and Mettaton had been becoming as of late, something deep down wanted to amend it to "one of the greatest nights of his life, so far".</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Quite honestly, darling..." Mettaton sighed. "I'm deeply worried."</p>
<p>On the screen of the phone, Papyrus tilted his head. "What's wrong, Metta?"</p>
<p>"It's just... it's <em>children</em>, darling!" A class of students was scheduled to drop by Mettaton's recording studio soon as part of a field trip; even though this had all been planned out in advance, Mettaton still couldn't help but feel nervous. "They don't always behave themselves; no matter how much I say not to touch certain equipment, I just know someone's going to do it anyway. Plus, I have to tone down my usual repertoire somewhat because they're children." He could just imagine someone's parents being angry at him because their child was scared or hurt, or just because he was Mettaton; he'd already had to put out at least one press release saying that he wore the color pink and dressed the way he did because he personally liked it, not because he was deliberately trying to "confuse" anyone.</p>
<p>Papyrus gave him an encouraging smile. "You can do it! You've had children on your show before, have you not?"</p>
<p>"Frisk was <em>one</em> child, and a well-behaved one at that. There were also extenuating circumstances, at least when we were still underground." By now, Frisk had become a young teenager, but they still appeared on Mettaton's programming from time to time, often as part of their duties as an ambassador. "This is an entire class full of children... children I don't personally know. I'm excited to share the things we do here, but I would hate for something to go wrong."</p>
<p>"Well, just remember: you're not alone! You have all the other workers in the studio to help you, do you not? And Napstablook and Shyren? And I'm sure the school officials will also help you!"</p>
<p>Mettaton thought for a moment; in truth, only some of the other workers would be able to help him, since the others were either off work today or weren't used to dealing with children. Even Napstablook and Shyren would probably run into a few issues here and there. But for field trips, a lot of preparation was required, and those who had volunteered to help were good with children.</p>
<p>He smiled. "I think you may have a point, sweetheart."</p>
<p>Papyrus nodded. "And if you're worried, you can always send me a text message! If you're allowed to, of course."</p>
<p>Just then, one of the technicians came into the room. "Mettaton, sir? I'm sorry to interrupt, but they're almost here."</p>
<p>"Thank you, beautiful. I'll be right there." He turned back towards the phone. "And thank <em>you,</em> Papyrus. It looks like we'll have to cut this conversation short, but I certainly feel better about this now."</p>
<p>"Of course! I, the Great Papyrus, love to help everyone believe in themselves!" He grinned. "And I believe in you, too!"</p>
<p>"Likewise."</p>
<p>Once the two said goodbye and hung up, Mettaton headed out towards the entrance to the studio, ready to greet the guests. Before long, he could see a school bus pulling up and stopping in front of the building.</p>
<p>The first person to emerge from it was none other than Toriel, who stepped off the bus and looked back inside. "Come along now, children! Mettaton is here, and I'm sure he's very excited to meet you all."</p>
<p>One by one, the children emerged from the bus. Some were humans, some were monsters, some showed their excitement by cheering, and others just smiled and waved. A couple of other chaperones emerged from the bus as well.</p>
<p>With a grin, Mettaton threw some glitter into the air. "Hello, beauties and gentlebeauties, and darlings of all ages! Welcome to my studio!"</p>
<p>Once more, the children clapped and cheered.</p>
<p>Toriel walked up next to Mettaton. "Now remember, children, a lot of the equipment in here is undoubtedly very expensive. So please keep your hands to yourselves unless Mettaton says otherwise. All right?"</p>
<p>The kids either nodded or said okay.</p>
<p>Mettaton also nodded. "Now that that's out of the way, why don't you all head into the lobby? There's an MTT-Brand goodie bag for each of you!"</p>
<p>While the kids and the chaperones headed inside, Toriel briefly stayed out to talk to Mettaton. "I know you're not one for dealing with entire groups of children, but I would still like to thank you very much for agreeing to do this." Her eyes had a sparkle to them. "They were all so excited when they saw you!"</p>
<p>"Well, Toriel, who wouldn't be excited to see <em>me?</em>" Mettaton flipped his hair a bit before leaning in close. "And don't worry; my technicians are making sure everything is as safe as possible."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mettaton. I'm afraid that sometimes children like to push boundaries on what is and isn't acceptable, and I certainly wouldn't want anyone to be injured."</p>
<p>"Neither would I." As much as Mettaton loved performances with drama, romance, and bloodshed, he greatly preferred fake bloodshed over the real thing. He gave her a warmer smile. "And also, I would like to thank you. As amazing as I am, I'm still no expert at dealing with children."</p>
<p>"I will be more than happy to help you if you need it." Toriel looked at the building. "Well, should we go inside?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely; let's not keep them waiting any longer."</p>
<p>As the two walked away from the school bus, Mettaton felt that this day could turn out better than he'd expected.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Papyrus never thought he'd appreciate having nothing to do.</p>
<p>In his eyes, there was always something to do, and time spent not doing anything was time being thrown away. Nobody ever became great and powerful and world-renowned because they just sat around; it was one of many reasons why he would always get annoyed at Sans' boondoggling. And when he found out that people - both monsters and humans - treated lazy days as <em>good</em> things? Something in his mind did not compute.</p>
<p>Even when he and Mettaton became close, he still found himself utterly puzzled the first time he discovered that Mettaton liked to take breaks from his work every now and then. Given that the man not only had a virtual monopoly on monster-produced entertainment, but seemed to love every minute of being in the spotlight, why would he want to stop for any reason? He wouldn't have been able to get so famous in the first place without putting in all that hard work.</p>
<p>The first time he'd voiced his confusion, Mettaton had just smiled and said, "Well, darling, part of the fun of being a celebrity is that sometimes you can afford not to work."</p>
<p>Initially, it did little to alleviate his confusion. Why would Mettaton not want to work? He was living his dream, and wasn't the whole idea of a dream job based around the fact that "you don't have to work a day in your life"?</p>
<p>And yet, as time went on and the two often found themselves separated because of their respective lines of work, Papyrus slowly began to realize that maybe, just maybe, Mettaton had a point.</p>
<p>There was one such day where the two were in the backyard, neither of them having a lot of work to do on that day. Papyrus didn't have to go into work because it was his weekend, and Mettaton was taking a bit of downtime after having recently finished a big project. And so, the two were lying in lawn chairs, with Mettaton lost in a romance novel while Papyrus stared at the clouds.</p>
<p>Just looking at the clouds, trying to find shapes in them... all with the faint sound of chirping birds and the occasional sound of Mettaton turning pages. One of the clouds looked like that small, white dog who liked to wander around town; Papyrus silently grumbled, remembering how hard it was to keep a bone collection when that dog treated it like his own personal buffet.</p>
<p>His gaze wandered elsewhere, with him hoping to think of literally anything other than that dog. Unfortunately, at the moment, none of the other clouds had shapes that he could easily discern, so he decided to look around at everything else. The leaves rustling from the very light breeze, the lush green grass mowed to a uniform style, Mettaton still absorbed in his novel...</p>
<p>For some reason, Papyrus just couldn't take his eyes off of Mettaton. And who could blame him? Mettaton was widely considered one of the most beautiful monsters that the entire Underground had ever seen, even before he had this form. The right amount of charisma could make even a rectangle on a wheel into one of the big symbols of beauty, after all. And when Papyrus first saw his more humanoid form, he was shocked that his human friend could come up with words in the essay question; if Papyrus had been on the show, the sight of Mettaton's lithe body would have struck him too speechless to answer. He loved every part of it, from that dark, rich hair that he later found out was surprisingly soft, to that handsomely expressive face, to the curves of his torso...</p>
<p>And of course, if one wished to praise Mettaton's EX form, there were two things that one simply could not overlook.</p>
<p>Papyrus' gaze traveled lower until he saw <em>them</em>. One was crossed over the other, and despite their current lack of movement, Papyrus's eyes felt glued to them.</p>
<p>Mettaton had the most amazing legs Papyrus had ever seen, and he was far from alone in having this opinion. People loved to praise them online, saying they were so hot that eggs could be fried on them, holding them up as examples of the kinds of legs they wished to have, and so on and so forth. It was really no surprise; not only were Mettaton's legs really long, they were curvy in all the right ways, and those pink stiletto boots framed them so well. And considering all the dancing, posing, and occasional exercising that Mettaton liked to do, and how much more his legs had gotten involved since he acquired them, it was clear that he, too, was proud of them.</p>
<p>Of course, if Papyrus had legs like those, he'd love to show them off, too.</p>
<p>"Gorgeous, aren't they?"</p>
<p>"Nyeh!" Papyrus looked up, noticing that Mettaton had turned his eyes away from his novel and was grinning at him. He felt his own face flush with orange magic. "F-forgive me..."</p>
<p>"What for? You did nothing wrong."</p>
<p>"It... it's rude to stare, is it not?"</p>
<p>"It would be if you were staring at one of my flaws." Mettaton started snickering. "<em>What</em> flaws? But anyway, I know how much you love my legs. I've had people tell me they could stare at them all day long. Completely understandable, in my not-very-humble opinion."</p>
<p>He leaned back, uncrossing his legs. "Dr. Alphys certainly knew what she was doing when she made these. I'd always wanted a long, beautiful pair of legs... and now I have them!" A smirk crossed his features. "And I know someone else whose legs aren't so bad, either."</p>
<p>"Really? Who?" If Mettaton of all people was saying this person's legs were amazing, it had to be true. Were they, perhaps, one of the people who inspired his EX form's design?</p>
<p>"Look straight ahead, and then look down."</p>
<p>Papyrus did so, and saw...</p>
<p>
  <em>...Oh my god.</em>
</p>
<p>He turned back towards Mettaton, feeling slightly dizzy. "You... you really think <em>my</em> legs are beautiful?"</p>
<p>"I <em>know</em> they're beautiful, sweetheart." Mettaton reached over, grabbed his hand, and gently kissed it. "You use them so frequently... you're such a diligent, hard worker."</p>
<p>"Wowie..." Papyrus couldn't help but slump back in his seat. He caught sight of the clouds again. "Ooh! I think that one's shaped like a heart!"</p>
<p>Mettaton glanced up at the cloud in question. "Oh my... you're right!"</p>
<p>While the two talked about random things, Papyrus (now feeling a little more confident about his body) thought about how none of this would have happened if they'd been working this afternoon. Maybe, in spite of their name, lazy days weren't so bad after all.</p>

  <p>"For the last time, darling" - judging by Mettaton's tone, it was clear that he was exercising all his self-control to prevent himself from adding an extra word between <em>last</em> and <em>time</em> - "we need to reschedule for tomorrow. My battery won't be able to hold up otherwise."</p>
<p>He sighed to himself. Even though his body was literally a machine, that didn't mean the man himself was entirely a performing machine. As much as he adored performing, he still looked forward to his down-time, especially in the months since he and Papyrus moved in together. Today had already been an exhausting day, and he'd been looking forward to a night of peace and quiet with the man he loved. Alas, shortly after the two finished dinner, someone from local news decided that the late evening would be a great time to ask him to drop by for an interview. As much as he would have liked to do the interview in other circumstances, tonight he was just <em>tired.</em> He'd been spending what had to have been at least a half-hour trying to negotiate with the newsperson over the phone. Papyrus sat next to him on the couch and frowned; he could tell Mettaton wasn't enjoying this.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>finally,</em> they seemed to reach an agreement, and after hanging up, Mettaton let out a loud sigh of relief and leaned in until his head was resting against Papyrus' shoulder. "Honestly! What part of 'I don't have enough battery life to conduct a full interview tonight' is so difficult to understand? Does she also expect human entertainers to conduct interviews when they need to sleep?"</p>
<p>Frowning, Papyrus put an arm around Mettaton and slipped Mettaton's hand into his own. "I'm sure she didn't mean any harm."</p>
<p>With another sigh, Mettaton closed his eyes. "I'm so sorry, Papyrus. Tonight was supposed to be a quiet, peaceful night for us. After all the work I did today, I was hoping we could have <em>something</em> before you have to go to work tomorrow."</p>
<p>Papyrus held on to Mettaton's hand more tightly, gently smiling. "It's not all bad. We got to have dinner together! I had a lot of fun cooking alongside you."</p>
<p>For the first time in the past half-hour (at least), Mettaton smiled. "Oh yes, that was certainly fun." The smile didn't last long. "Honestly, though, I was hoping to spend the rest of the night watching my shows with you. But after <em>that</em> little incident, we'll be lucky to get through two episodes without my battery shutting down on me."</p>
<p>He looked down. "I fear that, at this rate, there may be nothing else we can do tonight except go to sleep." Deep down, he couldn't hold back a sneer. All he wanted after a long day of work was a quiet night in with Papyrus! Did that lady not realize that the timing required for a face-to-face interview - both the travel times and the time spent on the interview itself - would cut into the time he needed to spend charging?</p>
<p>Papyrus could feel Mettaton's body tense up, and he frowned. "Metta..." He reached up, gently stroking Mettaton's hair. "I'm sure there's something else we could do."</p>
<p>Mettaton looked at him and raised an eyebrow, still frowning. "Such as?"</p>
<p>"W-well... there has to be something!" Still keeping one arm around Mettaton, Papyrus did a dramatic pose. "As your boyfriend, I, the Great Papyrus, consider it my duty to help you feel better when you need it! What kind of boyfriend would I be if I saw you feeling upset and did nothing about it? A subpar boyfriend, that's what! And I am not the Subpar Papyrus!"</p>
<p>As much as Mettaton admired how much Papyrus was dedicated to making him happy (especially since he would do the same for Papyrus), part of him wanted to say that Papyrus' current sentiments were wishful thinking, given how low his battery was. "Perhaps we should go upstairs and discuss this in the bedroom?"</p>
<p>"All right."</p>
<p>The two stood up, and as they went over to the stairs, Papyrus felt Mettaton take his hand. While they climbed, Papyrus thought about his boyfriend. Not long after they'd admitted that they were in love with each other, Papyrus had started wondering if it would be okay to hug Mettaton, or to hold hands with him, or to rest his skull on him like a pillow. Kissing was one thing (especially since, by design, Mettaton was usually the one to initiate it), but doing all those little things randomly? A celebrity like Mettaton seemed so untouchable; did someone like Papyrus even have the right?</p>
<p>And yet, it didn't take long for Mettaton to make it clear to him: not only did he allow Papyrus to touch him, he outright <em>encouraged</em> it.</p>
<p>In truth, considering that he'd had to live as an incorporeal ghost for so long before finally getting some kind of body - and then having to wait a while longer before finally getting the body he'd dreamed of - Mettaton was more than a little touch-starved. He yearned to feel people's hands on him, to be able to shake hands and hold hands and give hugs and really, literally <em>feel</em> people's love for him. After he and Papyrus started dating, if the two were in the same room together, then it was pretty much a guarantee that one of them at least had one hand on the other - if they weren't already in each other's arms. Of course, this had led to at least one instance of Undyne yelling at them to "get a room". But for Mettaton, being touched was a way of feeling appreciated; he finally had a body that made him feel like himself, and by touching it, people like Papyrus were showing their appreciation for his physical form.</p>
<p>As he pondered this, Papyrus couldn't help but feel an idea come to him.</p>
<p>Once they made it to the bedroom, Mettaton climbed into the bed, sighing for the umpteenth time that night as he pulled the covers over himself. Upon feeling the weight of Papyrus' body <em>not</em> joining him on the mattress, he sat up a little and gave him a curious glance. "Darling, is there any particular reason you're still standing in the doorway?"</p>
<p>Papyrus nodded. "I thought of something I could do for you. How long is your battery going to last?"</p>
<p>"I'd say about an hour at the most. After that, I have to plug in."</p>
<p>It was exactly what Papyrus needed to hear; he'd definitely have enough time. "All right. If you could just lie down on your front..."</p>
<p>As Mettaton flipped himself over and rested his chin on the pillow, he noticed the lights being dimmed to something a little more intimate. Part of him already had a very good idea of where this was going, but he initially wasn't sure if that voice was right.</p>
<p>He could hear Papyrus approach, and it wasn't long before he felt the blanket being lowered to just slightly above his hips. Before he could ask, he felt the weight of Papyrus' hands resting on his upper back; in almost no time, the hands began moving, gently pressing and rubbing the synthetic skin.</p>
<p>With a gasp, Mettaton closed his eyes. So far, this felt lovely, but something psychological crept up on him, and he tensed up without realizing it.</p>
<p>Just then, the hands froze. "Am I doing something wrong?"</p>
<p>"Not at all, darling." A deep breath. "Can I just ask one thing of you, though?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"When you reach the casing on my back, please leave it closed. My switch is located beneath that casing, and I have no desire to switch into my other form at the moment."</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>"Thank you so much, sweetheart." Mettaton could still remember this one time when he was out of town and decided to visit a local place for a massage. Unfortunately, as well-meaning as the therapist was, they'd decided that "don't open the casing on my back" was just a suggestion, and they'd opened it anyway. Apparently, they'd thought that he wouldn't be able to feel anything through the casing, which was simply not true. The sensation of those fingers poking around so close to his switch made him tense up even more; they didn't actually trigger it, but it would have taken just a slip of the hand, and then he'd feel his inner form shift until he was in his rectangle form again. When one goes to get a massage, one should feel relief from the act itself, not relief because it's over.</p>
<p>Fortunately, although he wasn't quite as skilled on a technical level, Papyrus was a much better listener than that therapist. Once he reached the area in question, Mettaton could feel him giving gentle strokes and rubbing circles into it without actually opening the casing. It was at this moment that Mettaton finally allowed himself to keep his eyes closed and just <em>breathe.</em></p>
<p>Papyrus... so loud and excitable, and yet so sweet and gentle. He did his current work in complete silence, a stark contrast from how much he liked to talk. Mettaton wasn't sure where he'd learned this or if he'd ever practiced on other people, but he was good at this, to the point where Mettaton couldn't hold back a quiet groan now and then. If Papyrus was trying to help him feel better, it was definitely working.</p>
<p>When Papyrus' hands pressed down particularly hard near the small of his back, Mettaton let out a loud moan; he could have just melted. "Yes..." As those hands worked that spot more and more, he allowed more moans and sighs to fall from his mouth, slowly forgetting the aggravation of earlier. Those hands had made so many puzzles, cooked so many meals, fixed so many cars, and now they were relieving tension... was there anything those hands couldn't do?</p>
<p>If he weren't worried about his battery, Mettaton certainly wouldn't have minded if this continued for hours. Indeed, he nearly found himself drifting in and out of power-saving mode as it went on. Sweet heavens above, he loved Papyrus so much.</p>
<p>
  <em>Just tell me how I can return the favor, darling, and I gladly will.</em>
</p>
<p>Papyrus eventually gave a few more decisive rubs, his hands lightening the pressure each time until they'd completely left Mettaton's back. For the first time since promising not to open Mettaton's casing, Papyrus spoke. "You can flip back over now."</p>
<p>"Mmph..." Mettaton rolled onto his back, opening his eyes a little with a languid smile. He could feel Papyrus flipping open the much smaller casing on his hip.</p>
<p>"Now that I think about it, I'm sorry I wasn't able to make it more professional for you," Papyrus said as he plugged Mettaton's charging cable into the wall. He thought about how he could have used an actual massage table, or some soft music, or even just some massage oil.</p>
<p>"It's perfectly all right, darling." Mettaton stretched his arms and legs a little, feeling more limber even as he felt the charging cable being plugged into his hip; the gentle currents began to soothe his mind even more. "That was still absolutely splendid."</p>
<p>Just by listening to Mettaton's tone and seeing the gentle look on his face, Papyrus could tell he wasn't just saying that to help him feel better. "Wowie..." He walked over to the other side of the bed and climbed in, soon feeling a pair of metallic arms pulling him close, quickly followed by a long kiss.</p>
<p>"Thank you..." Mettaton whispered after the kiss was over; his eyes were tightly closed, and his voice made it clear that it wouldn't be long before he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Papyrus warmly smiled and gently stroked his hair, whispering, "You're beautiful and special to me, Metta."</p>
<p>That was the last thing Mettaton heard before falling asleep, and after the now-mostly-forgotten events of that evening, he wouldn't have wanted it any other way.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Papyrus diligently worked at making breakfast, currently working at making the hash browns crispy without burning them, when he heard the distinctive sound of Mettaton's heels.</p>
<p>"Good morning, sugar skull!"</p>
<p>"Good morning, my beautiful, shimmering star!" Papyrus glanced at him, smiling. "I'll have breakfast ready in a few minutes!"</p>
<p>Mettaton smiled and went to sit down at the table. Before long, Papyrus finished cooking, and he joined Mettaton at the table with the food and some milk.</p>
<p>"Darling?" Mettaton said a few minutes after they started eating. "I just wanted to thank you for last night. That was simply wonderful."</p>
<p>"I'm very glad you liked it, Metta! I didn't want you to go to sleep feeling disappointed. It wouldn't be right of me." Just then, he grinned. "Oh, and by the way. If you'd like me to give you another massage sometime, all you have to do is ask."</p>
<p>"I would love to take you up on that offer." Mettaton locked eyes with him. "On one condition."</p>
<p>"Nyeh?"</p>
<p>With a grin of his own, Mettaton leaned forward slightly. "Let me know when <em>you're</em> feeling exhausted, so I can spoil you in return."</p>
<p>Papyrus could certainly get used to that arrangement.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Hey, Metta?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sweetheart?"</p>
<p>"Is there a place that also does spaghetti tastings?"</p>
<p>The two were in Mettaton's often-handy limo, traveling home from a wine tasting at the local vineyard. Mettaton had been there a few times to sample their wares, but this was the first time he'd brought Papyrus with him. It had been rather educational for Papyrus; he'd learned how to tell different types of wine apart from each other. The smell, the taste, the aftertaste, and even the exact color all played a role in differentiating the varieties. Papyrus had even learned a few things about which types of wine went well with different types of food.</p>
<p>Mettaton leaned back, looking out the window at the city lights that were coming into view. "Hmm... as far as I know, I don't think there are. I think you have to buy a full plate at most places." He glanced at Papyrus with a grin. "Although... you could be the person who makes it trendy."</p>
<p>"Nyeh heh heh! Of course!" Papyrus sat upright. "After all, just like with wine, there are many important things to consider for every dish of spaghetti. The types of noodles, how long the noodles are cooked, what kind of sauce you're using, the type of meat you're using - if you're using meat at all..." Suddenly, it felt like a lightbulb went on in his head. "Ooh! I have an idea!"</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"What if you and I worked together to figure out which types of wine go best with different types of spaghetti? After what I've learned today, I'm very certain that what works for bolognese might not work for carbonara, for example."</p>
<p>"Hmm... you might be onto something, darling." Mettaton was now imagining himself and Papyrus making videos and/or blogs explaining which types of spaghetti should have which types of wine served with it. What would they call it though? <em>Pasta and Wine Pairings with a Killer Robot and a Sweet Skeleton?</em> Kind of a long title...</p>
<p>"Yes! Like, for example, spaghetti served with beef should be paired with red wine - preferably a lighter variety because the flavor of the sauce is rather heavy! And... oh no! I'm out of ideas already!" Despite the brief setback, Papyrus still grinned. "But you and I can come up with more ideas! And then we'll be able to help everyone have the best spaghetti dinners ever!"</p>
<p>Mettaton smiled; he would definitely have to bring Papyrus along the next time he went to a wine tasting.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Searching</h2>

  
  </div>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>For the longest time, Mettaton dreamed of the day where he could finally have a true confidant, the kind of person to whom he could admit all of his darkest fears and worries without being told that he was wrong for feeling that way.</p>
<p>In the earlier years of his life, he would look to his relatives, especially Napstablook, for this type of comfort. However, as the relatives moved on to different things, he became more and more reluctant to confess everything to Napstablook. They'd already seen their other cousins leave; they didn't need to hear that their one remaining cousin also wanted to get a body and leave. It would break their sensitive spectral heart. And yet, Mettaton hadn't wanted to lie to them and say that he was perfectly content with his ghost form and his life on the snail farm.</p>
<p>Dr. Alphys had been another person he'd grown to appreciate, ever since the day she showed up at his human fanclub meeting, and especially after she promised to make him a body. But as he eventually discovered, she had tons of problems and insecurities of her own. Sometimes he would find himself butting heads with her; she didn't seem to want to even try pulling herself out of the hole she was in, while he didn't seem to realize just how heavy the weight of her problems was. There was one day in which he'd taken it upon himself to put his foot down regarding some of her secrets.</p>
<p>"You can't keep hiding forever," he'd said.</p>
<p>But then, she'd just glared at him and said, "Neither can you."</p>
<p>Understandably, the two didn't speak much after that until around two weeks later, when Alphys saw a human entering Snowdin Forest. After the barrier fell and both admitted their big mistakes, their friendship slowly but surely began repairing itself. Of course, Alphys' main confidant by that point had become Undyne, and while that wasn't likely to change anytime soon (nor did Mettaton want it to; he'd been so happy that Alphys finally admitted her feelings that he outright egged them on to kiss when everyone gathered in Asgore's throne room), the tension between her and Mettaton slowly began to evaporate.</p>
<p>On that fateful day underground, Mettaton also got to know a child named Frisk. At first, he thought they were a weak child; even though they were able to get through his challenges, it wasn't much of a consolation since everything was rigged anyway. Not even their managing to make it through his altered version of the Core and befriend his hired mercenaries was enough to convince him; he knew Asgore would want to fight the child, and so he took it upon himself to not only save Asgore the trouble, but also prevent the second war that he knew would happen if Asgore acquired Frisk's soul. But after Frisk accidentally introduced his EX form to the world (they'd told him some time after the fact that they didn't know what the switch on his back did), his ratings went through the roof, and he realized that Frisk was much stronger than he'd thought. They hadn't even needed to attack his body to prove it (though they did use soul magic to fire at his soul, making his limbs blow off).</p>
<p>Of course, once the barrier fell, he and Frisk became relatively fast friends. They couldn't always see each other, between Frisk having both ambassador duties and school while Mettaton had his own surface breakthrough to worry about, but they would still collaborate every now and then, with Frisk sometimes appearing on Mettaton's programming. Also, when everyone would gather for special occasions, the two would have fun talking to each other, and they would even sing songs together on occasion.</p>
<p>And yet, in spite of all this, even Frisk wasn't the confidant Mettaton was looking for. They were, after all, still a child, and in Mettaton's life, there were some topics that someone of their age might not have been ready to handle.</p>
<p>But then, with help from both Frisk and Undyne, Mettaton found himself getting acquainted with these two skeleton brothers.</p>
<p>Sans was... interesting, to say the least. He certainly loved pulling pranks and making bad jokes to get a rise out of his brother or whomever else, but he never did it to cause deliberate harm. From what Mettaton could tell, he also seemed to be rather lazy. And yet... he felt traces of something else when he was around Sans. He got the impression that Sans may have been more intelligent than he let on... that he knew things no human or monster was meant to know, and that the weight of it all was threatening his very sanity. Something about the way he carried himself, and the way he talked...</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whenever Mettaton spent time with Sans' younger and taller brother Papyrus, he got a different sort of vibe. Papyrus loved to go on at length about how much of a fan he was of Mettaton's work, but something about him felt a little different than most of his fans. Mettaton loved it when his fans treated him like their hero, but Papyrus also treated him like a person. He never made anyone else feel lesser just because Mettaton happened to be in the room; instead, he preferred to share his joy with everyone.</p>
<p>And perhaps more importantly, whenever Papyrus saw that even Mettaton wasn't perfect, he did not act like the world was ending just because his favorite celebrity was a flawed person.</p>
<p>One rainy day, Mettaton had to stay at the brothers' house for the afternoon because of a huge rainstorm, and he'd pretty much lost all composure, throwing himself into a panic because he was supposed to meet with his cast and crew to start filming his first new TV series on the surface; this show would be the thing that would make or break his surface career, since Delta Rune Network was still new and mostly focused on reruns. If it didn't get ratings, then Mettaton's career would probably go with it, with him being thought of as a vintage novelty at the most.</p>
<p>And yet, when Papyrus saw Mettaton unload all of his emotions, seeing a panicked man in fear of losing his job instead of the superstar he normally was, his first reaction was to comfort him. Not say things like "I thought you were better than that", not whip out his phone and film the freak-out so he could upload it on the internet for everyone to laugh at, not tell him that he was a celebrity and thus had no reason to ever be upset about anything. No, instead he offered to be friends with Mettaton, gave him a hug, and even called him later that night just to make sure he was still okay. Even though he was seeing Mettaton at one of his lowest points in years, he didn't let that stop him from caring about the man behind the celebrity.</p>
<p>Ever since that day, Mettaton slowly began to let his walls down more and more around Papyrus. He began to talk to Papyrus about things that he wouldn't even bring up around Napstablook or Frisk or Alphys; even though Papyrus didn't always understand the exact nature of some of Mettaton's problems, he would still do his best to help him cheer up. Sometimes he'd offer some friendly words, sometimes he'd give Mettaton a hug, and sometimes he'd just listen while Mettaton would vent.</p>
<p>After a while, Mettaton felt so secure around Papyrus that he knew for sure, despite Papyrus' occasional odd mannerisms, that he was a true friend. Eventually, there came a day where he realized that he wanted something more than friendship from him. With Papyrus, he felt like he had someone who understood him.</p>
<p>He no longer had to worry about searching for a confidant; when Papyrus was there, he felt free.</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"So, how was the interview?"</p>
<p>Mettaton couldn't resist a dry laugh. "Would you like to know the truth, darling?"</p>
<p>"All right." Papyrus tilted his head; did it not go well?</p>
<p>Looking Papyrus in the eye, Mettaton leaned in and took a deep breath. "I wish I had a dollar for every time someone made a big deal out of the fact that I'm dating an auto mechanic."</p>
<p>Papyrus blinked. "Nyeh? What's wrong with dating an auto mechanic? They're very helpful people! I see one in the mirror all the time!"</p>
<p>"There's nothing wrong with dating an auto mechanic, sweetheart." Mettaton sighed. "But not according to the news media. They expected me to date another celebrity."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm also a celebrity of sorts!" Papyrus smiled. "Sometimes when Frisk has to do ambassador work, they have me serve as their mascot! I have some very important duties as a mascot: stand around and look cute! And sometimes talk to people."</p>
<p>"And I'd say you're a natural at all of those. Especially looking cute." Mettaton kissed Papyrus' skull and put an arm around him, feeling him lean in close and hearing his happy sigh. "Unfortunately, all the media sees is me dating an auto mechanic, which, according to them, means I don't have standards."</p>
<p>He sneered. Although he loved performing and being in the spotlight, he had no idea how some of the people associated with the news media could be so toxic. Focusing on mistakes instead of what was good, acting like his own opinions didn't matter... and he just knew that if he made it clear in these interviews that Papyrus was also the ambassador's mascot, people would accuse him of making his future work political. Not to mention the people who saw that Papyrus was a fan of his, and immediately jumped to some appalling conclusions (such as Mettaton just wanting a sycophant).</p>
<p>"But I know you have high standards, Metta. You always told me you did, and that it was why you weren't dating anyone yet."</p>
<p>Mettaton nodded. "Admittedly, there were times when I would dream of meeting a fellow celebrity and becoming a power couple of sorts with them. We'd appear on the front page of all the magazines, as well as promote each other's work..." He looked up. "And yet, in my heart, I wanted to be with someone who truly made me happy. Someone who wouldn't judge me or use my less-proud moments against me..." With a smile, he turned towards Papyrus and kissed him again. "And now, I have such a person in my life. The fact that he's an auto mechanic instead of a fellow A-list celebrity is irrelevant. Or at least, it should be."</p>
<p>"Nyeh..." Papyrus could have been floating. For someone like him, who'd always wanted to be cool, what higher compliment could he receive than having the person he admired most tell him "you've truly made me happy"?</p>
<p>"In fact..." Mettaton took out his cell phone, snapped a quick photo of himself and Papyrus snuggled up on the couch like that, and posted it on social media, with the following caption: <em>Yes, I'm dating an auto mechanic. No, this does not mean I don't have standards. Papyrus makes me feel happy and comfortable, and what higher standard is there? </em></p>
<p>As the two continued to hold each other close, Mettaton noticed that he was already getting some comments.</p>
<p>"As someone who's married to an auto mechanic, I want to know who thinks it means you don't have standards! Auto mechanics are amazing people."</p>
<p>"Don't listen to the naysayers! You two are so freaking adorable!"</p>
<p>"I hope the people who accuse you of not having standards never have trouble with their cars, if that's what they think of mechanics! Best wishes for both you and Papyrus!"</p>
<p>He smiled. Even if the news media didn't recognize certain truths, his fans certainly did.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Alphys frowned, wondering what had happened in the time it had taken her to pick up the drinks for everyone. Before she left, Undyne, Mettaton, and Papyrus were all going to cook spaghetti together; now it was just Mettaton sitting alone and sulking.</p>
<p>"Mettaton?" She walked over and took a seat on the couch, setting the drinks on the table. "What happened? Where is everybody?"</p>
<p>Mettaton sighed, resting his head on his hand, his elbow on the recliner's arm. "Papyrus and Undyne left to take a drive around town. Things were very... not good earlier."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Another sigh. "So, we were making spaghetti, like we had planned. This was supposed to be fun. But Undyne...!" He leaned back. "Now, I mean no disrespect to her as a person, but... who taught her how to cook? Seriously, darling! I thought it was bad enough that she was going to make a mess everywhere, and that she damaged some of the equipment... but then, she almost started a fire."</p>
<p>"Y-yeah..." Alphys gave a nervous laugh; while her fiancee was good at a lot of things, cooking was not one of them, unfortunately. "She's done that sometimes, especially underground. Good thing we have smoke detectors."</p>
<p>"Yes, well... speaking of the smoke detectors, they went off while we were cooking." He grumbled. "I told her not to throw the box in there...!" A deep breath. "So then I panicked, and I disposed of the contents, and, well... Undyne and I got into a shouting match."</p>
<p>He could still remember himself and Undyne shouting over the smoke detectors:</p>
<p>
  <em>"Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?"</em>
</p>
<p><em>"What am </em>I<em> doing? What are </em>you<em> doing? This isn't how spaghetti is cooked at all!"</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"Papyrus and I have always done it this way! You just got rid of all that hard work!"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Well, he needs to forget your methods, because you're doing it wrong!"</em>
</p>
<p>Mettaton stared up at the ceiling. "And I think our shouting, combined with the smoke detectors... it was all too much for Papyrus. By the time we stopped the alarm, he had left the kitchen. We found him in here; he was curled up on the couch and repeating 'we don't have to fight'." With a sad sigh, he tilted his head back down, his hair covering both of his eyes. "He looked so terrified... I think he was shaking."</p>
<p>"Oh no..."</p>
<p>"And when we tried to talk to him, he said he didn't want us to argue anymore, because we're his friends..." He rested his face in his hands. "He told us that it felt like we were making him choose between us. Undyne managed to convince him to drive around town for a little while with her, and that's why I was alone until you came back."</p>
<p>"Mettaton..." Alphys scooted closer on the couch, trying to think of a way to comfort her friend. She certainly understood why Papyrus would have been upset; no one wants to feel like they have to take sides when two of the people they care about the most are in an explosive argument. If she had to choose between Undyne and Mettaton, she'd be upset too. "I'm sure you didn't mean to make him feel that way."</p>
<p>"I didn't. But I couldn't just stand there and let Undyne set fire to the house! This is where you both live!" Yet another sigh. "It's just... if we're going to cook together, she can't use those methods anymore. I can accept having to clean up a mess, but cooking equipment is supposed to last for a long time - that's why, unless I really need it, I always keep my chainsaw in storage these days - and the act of boiling noodles isn't supposed to start a fire! Undyne could have inhaled all that smoke, or the house could have been destroyed..." Just because Mettaton loved taking risks didn't mean he didn't care about the safety of his closest friends.</p>
<p>Alphys wasn't sure of what to say; Mettaton did have a point, but she didn't know how to convince Undyne to change her mind. While she was far better at cooking than Undyne (at least Alphys could prepare box dinners correctly), she still was nowhere close to being an expert.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she didn't have to dwell on that for too long, as the front door soon opened, with Papyrus and Undyne walking through. Both appeared to have calmed down quite a bit since Mettaton had last seen them.</p>
<p>"Hey, Mettaton, we're back--" Undyne noticed Alphys on the couch. "Whoa, hey, Alphys. Didn't know you were back, too." She glanced at the recliner where Mettaton was still sitting. "So I'm guessing Mettaton told you why we weren't here when you got back?"</p>
<p>Alphys nodded.</p>
<p>Papyrus stepped forward, looking somewhat morose. "That reminds me... Mettaton, can we talk in the other room? I'm not angry with you; I would just like to talk in private."</p>
<p>Despite the reassurances, Mettaton still felt the tiniest weight of dread resting on his soul (as everyone does when told someone needs to talk to them). Regardless, he stood up. "All right."</p>
<p>The two walked into a different room where they would be out of earshot of the girls. Once Papyrus was sure they were alone, he spoke. "Mettaton, I was hoping to talk about earlier."</p>
<p>At that moment, Mettaton decided to cut to the chase, looking down in guilt. "Darling, I'm very sorry. I never meant to make you feel like you had to choose between me and Undyne. Nor did I mean to make you panic."</p>
<p>"I know. And I understand it was an accident. It's just..." Papyrus took deep breaths, his hands fidgeting a little as he tried to stay calm. "I don't want to forget about cooking with Undyne. Even though the Royal Guard has disbanded, I still have several good memories of training with her. We would make spaghetti all the time; sometimes we would practice our magic as well. There were even a few times where she tried to teach me how to play the piano... I never quite mastered it, despite being great in other areas."</p>
<p>Mettaton chuckled, despite himself. "Oh yes, Undyne's piano..." He himself was no stranger to it; it provided such a lovely view of the room for him while he snacked on grapes.</p>
<p>Papyrus nodded. "But as I was trying to say... Undyne was my first friend, aside from my brother. She and I would always cook spaghetti together, and so now that you and I are friends, I thought all three of us could do it, and we'd all have so much fun." Once more, he started trembling a bit. "But... it didn't work that way. Undyne and I were cooking it the way we always did... if I'd known you didn't like cooking it that way, I would have suggested some kind of compromise."</p>
<p>"Sweetheart, I was just worried that the house would be set on fire. To my understanding, the infrastructure of surface houses isn't as durable as the houses were underground." Ever since moving to the surface, he had to learn his share of things about fire safety in order to be allowed to perform; fortunately, he learned the vast majority of it the easy way. "I just didn't want Alphys to come home to a destroyed house... although I do admit that I might have panicked a little. Especially when the alarms went off."</p>
<p>"Nyeh..." Papyrus rubbed the back of his skull. "Now that I think about it, I probably should have told you how Undyne and I make spaghetti <em>before</em> we started."</p>
<p>Mettaton resisted the urge to chuckle dryly; it seemed that even the greatest people (such as himself and Papyrus) weren't immune to making mistakes. "I am by no means saying you have to stop cooking with her, by the way. I'm just suggesting that the two of you should... alter your methods. Preferably in a way that makes it less likely for a fire to break out."</p>
<p>"We could do that, but then Undyne might say that it isn't fun anymore."</p>
<p>"That's why you <em>make</em> it fun... in ways that don't create fire hazards, of course." He looked at the door. "Perhaps we should ask Undyne and Alphys about this?"</p>
<p>With another nod, Papyrus followed him to the door.</p>
<p>Once they were out in the front room again, Undyne approached them. "Hey, guys, I've been talking with Alphys, and, well... Mettaton kind of had a point. We kinda shouldn't start fires in the kitchen, especially since most houses on the surface can't handle magic fire like underground houses." She muttered under her breath, "Even though I'm gonna kinda miss the carnage..." Still, she could always get her share of carnage through a video game or something similar; she realized that she and Alphys might get into trouble with the local authorities if a fire broke out.</p>
<p>Alphys nodded and adjusted her glasses. "So, uh... you wanna try cooking again, or is it too soon?"</p>
<p>"What do you think, Papyrus?" Mettaton set a hand on Papyrus' shoulder.</p>
<p>"Well...!" Papyrus thought for a second, before coming to a decision. "I think we should, so today can end on a good note."</p>
<p>With that settled, everyone went back to the kitchen. Mettaton and Alphys took charge this time, showing Papyrus and Undyne how spaghetti is properly cooked; the two were still able to make some (less dangerous) contributions. By the time they'd finished, the resulting spaghetti (while not bringing the house down either literally or metaphorically) was a resounding improvement over earlier attempts.</p>
<p>By the time Papyrus and Mettaton went back to their respective homes, everyone had forgiven each other. They all vowed not to forget this day, though - not out of a desire to hold grudges, but instead to use it as a learning experience.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Just my luck! Just my rotten luck!"</p>
<p>Papyrus didn't know which storm was more intense at the moment: the rainstorm that was raging outside, or the emotional storm that Mettaton was going through at the moment. At first, Papyrus couldn't have been happier to have Mettaton in his home; he was more than willing to offer his house as shelter from the rainstorm - at least until the roads stopped being flooded - and Sans was all right with it as well, even though he was currently choosing to spend time in his room instead of in the front room with the other two.</p>
<p>But Mettaton, though grateful for the shelter, was anything but happy.</p>
<p>"We were supposed to start filming our first show on the surface today! If this rainstorm doesn't end soon, we won't be able to film at all until further notice!" Mettaton, who had sprawled himself on the couch, flipped over and buried his face in the couch's arm, shuddering a little.</p>
<p>Papyrus frowned, walking up to him. "You can always film on a different day... can't you?"</p>
<p>Mettaton looked up at him, looking rather irritated; his eyes were threatening to fill with tears, though. "You really don't understand the gravity of this situation, do you, darling? There are deadlines we have to meet. If we don't get enough progress done soon, we could easily get cancelled! And if we don't have a new show for the upcoming season, Delta Rune Network might fail! People can only tolerate reruns for so long; if I don't release something new, the humans are going to assume I'm just some novelty, and the monsters..." His head lowered again. "They might move on from me..."</p>
<p>Deciding to sit on the floor nearby, Papyrus looked at him. "I won't move on from you. I love your shows and performances."</p>
<p>"I appreciate that, darling. However..." Rolling back over, Mettaton turned his attention to the ceiling. "With all due respect, you're just one person. I need an entire audience in order to be able to sustain my ratings and keep my shows on the air."</p>
<p>His arm dangled, fingertips nearly brushing the floor, as he continued, his voice quiet and distant. "If I don't have an audience... that's it. I'm finished. Mettaton will be a has-been, a thing of the past, a relic of the days underground whom the monsters no longer needed after moving to the surface, a footnote on those where-are-they-now shows..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, he threw himself into an upright position and cried out in frustration, his emotions boiling over. "Of all the days to have a rainstorm this severe! Why couldn't it have been yesterday? Would that have been so difficult? Oh, sure, go ahead and flood the town! It's not like people's livelihoods are on the line!" Several horrible thoughts entered Mettaton's head: being reduced to a punchline for stand-up comedians, being thought of as "old news", having to go back to life doing a mundane job where no one cared who he was...</p>
<p>
  <em>How the mighty have fallen...</em>
</p>
<p>He allowed himself to collapse onto the other end of the couch, where he buried his face in the arm and allowed some sobs to escape his throat.</p>
<p>As Papyrus watched this unfold, he wished he had an idea of what to say. He had posters of Mettaton, as well as a picture of him for his phone's lock screen, and all of them displayed a confident, glamorous man who was going to take the world by the horns - and do it with style. And yet, on his couch right now was the same man, stripped of his confidence and glamour, seriously and honestly afraid of no longer being able to live his dreams.</p>
<p>Although he wasn't sure of what exactly to say, Papyrus knew he had to say something. He couldn't just sit and watch. So, he stood up and walked over.</p>
<p>"Would you like a hug, Mettaton?"</p>
<p>Mettaton looked up at him, his eyes stained with tears, and silently nodded.</p>
<p>Sitting next to him, Papyrus pulled him close, his hand gently moving up and down Mettaton's back. "It's okay if you need to cry. Sometimes my other friends need to cry, and there's nothing wrong with that."</p>
<p><em>Other friends?</em> Papyrus considered him a friend? The two hadn't even interacted much yet; he could count the number of times they'd interacted beforehand, and not reach the double digits.</p>
<p>As if reading his thoughts, Papyrus continued. "I can be your friend if you need one. Everyone should have a cool friend to help them feel better."</p>
<p>Mettaton exhaled; did Papyrus really mean that, or was he just saying that because he liked Mettaton's work?</p>
<p>"Think about it this way, Mettaton: it's only one day. If you all work really hard, you might be able to make up for it, and then it'll be like you weren't behind schedule!"</p>
<p>"I hope it's only one day," Mettaton said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"I'm sure they'll understand, since the weather is being so unreasonable today." Papyrus grabbed the remote. "Here, I can turn on the news! Then we can find out when it'll be safe for you to go home."</p>
<p>"All right."</p>
<p>Papyrus switched on the TV and went to one of the local news channels. The two sat on the couch for a long time afterwards, watching for any updates; Sans came downstairs once or twice to ask if they needed anything. As stressed as Mettaton was, Papyrus never lost his patience with him; he listened as Mettaton occasionally complained about the time it was taking, saying that he wouldn't be able to charge because his charging cable was at home.</p>
<p>(He'd left his house to go on a shopping trip, picking up some supplies for the forecasted rainy weather, among other things; he hadn't expected the rain to kick in that soon, and especially not that heavily. After calling Alphys and Undyne, they'd recommended that he stay at the skeleton brothers' house until the worst of it was over, since it was the closest to where he currently was. Even after eventually acquiring a limo, Mettaton would be forever grateful for taxi cabs because of the events of today.)</p>
<p>Bit by bit, Mettaton began calming down, occasionally sending text messages to his cast and crew, giving them updates on the situation. Some of them said similar things that Papyrus did, saying that when they finally could start filming, they could work extra-hard to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>Finally, later that evening, the weather died down enough that Mettaton was able to call another cab and safely go home. Before he left, he and Papyrus exchanged phone numbers.</p>
<p>"If you ever need to talk to me, just go ahead and call me! I, the Great Papyrus, always answer within the first two rings!"</p>
<p>By now, Mettaton finally felt like smiling again. "Thank you, darling."</p>
<p>As Mettaton rode back home in the back of the cab, he checked social media, and found that some gossip magazine had caught wind of his crew being delayed that day. The headline read, <em>Is Mettaton's surface career over before it started?</em></p>
<p>Mettaton scoffed to himself; he was trying, and if the tabloids couldn't handle him at his worst, they didn't deserve him at his best.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
  <em>Wait a minute.</em>
</p>
<p>In that moment, Mettaton had an epiphany. That afternoon, Papyrus - a long-time fan of his - had seen him at his worst; he saw him lose control of his emotions, freak out about the future, and even burst into tears. And yet, instead of treating him like a joke or allowing his pedestal to be broken, Papyrus offered sympathy and a hand of friendship, even giving Mettaton his phone number.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that Mettaton realized the truth.</p>
<p>Papyrus was no longer merely a fan of his. By now, he wasn't even just a friend of a friend.</p>
<p>Papyrus was his friend.</p>
<hr/>
<p>(Later that night, after Mettaton made it home, he gave Papyrus a call to thank him for everything earlier. True to his word, Papyrus answered within the first two rings. The two talked for what felt like hours after that.)</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>All things considered, today was shaping up to be a pretty good day. Mettaton hummed to himself as he walked through the park; Papyrus was supposed to meet up with him pretty soon, but the traffic was delaying him quite a bit. Once Papyrus did arrive, the two would film a vlog for all their followers. And today was a nice day outside; a cloudless sky, chirping birds, people having fun...</p>
<p>"Mettaton...!"</p>
<p>As well as fans recognizing him and telling him how amazing he was.</p>
<p>Mettaton smiled at the young woman running up to him. "Hello, beautiful!" He always loved his fans telling him they loved him.</p>
<p>Once the woman made it to him, she held up a photograph of him. "Mettaton! I've been looking for you! I have all your merchandise! Would you please sign this for me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, absolutely!"</p>
<p>"Oh my god! Thank you!"</p>
<p>Mettaton took out his pen. "And who do I have the honor of making this out to, darling?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, the look on the woman's face became a little more devious. "Your girlfriend, of course."</p>
<p>Mettaton's thumb froze in mid-air before he could click his pen. After a few seconds of stunned silence, he chuckled. "Actually, darling, I have a <em>boy</em>friend."</p>
<p>"Well, now you have a girlfriend instead."</p>
<p>"...what?" With a slightly nervous laugh, Mettaton cleared his throat, taking a slight step back. "No, darling, I have a boyfriend. His name is Papyrus, and I quite adore him. He's appeared in a lot of my recent videos. As much as I'm flattered by your offer, I have to politely decline."</p>
<p>"Come on..." The woman approached more until she was pretty much in Mettaton's face. "What does he have that I don't have?"</p>
<p>Mettaton rolled his eyes, the cracks in his patience beginning to show. "Well, for starters, he respects my personal space." As much as Mettaton loved being touched, he had to draw the line somewhere.</p>
<p>"Yeah, and what does he do for a living? Fix cars?" The woman smirked. "I have a more creative job. You'll be able to bring me on your tours all over the world! We could start a family together! I could give you so much more than any stupid, greasy auto mechanic can give you." She laughed. "Probably didn't even finish school..."</p>
<p>More than any <em>what now?</em></p>
<p>"Welly. Welly. Well then." The pen returned to Mettaton's pocket, and he turned on his heel and began walking away. "If you're going to stoop to the level of insulting the people I love, then I'm leaving. I have better things to do."</p>
<p>The woman followed him, but when she caught sight of a certain someone entering the park, she smirked and ran in front of Mettaton, raising her voice. "So you <em>will</em> go out with me, Mettaton?"</p>
<p>"What? I never said--!"</p>
<p>And then the woman pulled him close and rammed her lips into his. His eyes could have bugged out, and he squirmed around, trying to break free. She had a tight grip on him, but he was looking for any means of escape.</p>
<p>Finally, once she let up a bit, Mettaton found an opening and pushed her away; if looks could kill, the one he was now giving her could have sent anyone to Hell. "Get away from me!"</p>
<p>"Mettaton?"</p>
<p>Both he and the woman turned towards the new voice; Mettaton trembled slightly, while the woman smirked again. It was Papyrus, who apparently had seen everything.</p>
<p>The woman was almost gleeful in those milliseconds she spent imagining what could happen. Would Papyrus just run away crying? Or would he tell Mettaton off? Maybe he'd call him every nasty name in the book, or say other horrible things, or even attack him! Anything could have happened at this point, and then Mettaton would be hers!</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the woman, and fortunately for Mettaton, she did not know Papyrus very well.</p>
<p>Papyrus ran up to him, the look on his face one of concern, not of anger. "Is everything all right? Are you hurt?"</p>
<p>With a smile, Mettaton sighed in relief. "Aside from that massive invasion of my personal space just now, I'm not hurt."</p>
<p>"That's good! Well, except for your personal space being invaded." The woman watched as Papyrus turned towards her and folded his arms, looking rather annoyed. "You know, you really shouldn't kiss people without their permission. It makes them feel unsafe. And I know you don't want to be thought of as an unsafe person to be around, so please don't do that."</p>
<p>"I... what..." This was not what the woman had planned. "He said he wanted to go out with me!"</p>
<p>Papyrus wasn't convinced. "I'm pretty sure he didn't say that. He and I smooch each other all the time, and he never glares at me or pushes me away or yells at me to get away from him."</p>
<p>"The thing is, darling..." Mettaton slipped an arm around Papyrus' shoulders. "This woman apparently didn't realize that the boyfriend I was telling her about was the one and only Great Papyrus. Some of the things she had the gall to say about you... never have I heard such blatantly false statements since the time someone online said my shows air too much!"</p>
<p>The woman wished a hole would open up in the sidewalk and make her fall into a parallel dimension.</p>
<p>Mettaton took one step closer to her. "Look me in the eye, darling." She did so; the look on his face was that of a man who was going to lay down the law. "I don't care if you think Papyrus is, to quote your words, just a stupid, greasy auto mechanic who didn't even finish school. What's important is that he's my favorite auto mechanic - and none of the other ways in which you described him are accurate at all. He makes me happy, and if you're so unwilling to accept our love for each other that you'd resort to attempting to sabotage our relationship, then I have to question just how much of a fan of mine you really are. Love me, love my loved ones. That's what I say."</p>
<p>He turned and started towards a distant tree. "Come on, Papyrus. As I was saying earlier, we have better things to do."</p>
<p>As Papyrus watched Mettaton walking away, the woman sighed. "I wanted to go out with him... why'd you have to find him first?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes life is freaking weird." Truth be told, Papyrus himself had never imagined dating Mettaton until the two had actually started bonding. He looked at the woman. "I hope you take this as a lesson in how not to treat people."</p>
<p>"Are you coming, darling?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Oh! Yes!" Papyrus waved goodbye to the woman, who sighed and walked away, and ran off to see Mettaton.</p>
<p>Mettaton laughed as Papyrus approached. "No, sweetheart, I'm the one who says 'oh yes'."</p>
<p>"I don't get a special boyfriend privilege?"</p>
<p>"Actually, now that you mention it..."</p>
<p>As the two got ready to film their vlog, they knew that they had a really strong bond - and that it would take far more than a desperate attempt by some jealous fan in order to drive a wedge between them.</p>

    <p>Chapter End Notes</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hey folks, let me level with you here for a second.</p>
<p>Did I ever tell you how much I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE the following love story cliche?</p>
<p>"A and B are in a relationship, but C wants B, so C flirts with and possibly forces a kiss on a very unwilling B, and when A sees them, A automatically assumes the worst of B. A runs off crying (possibly after having insulted B), C does some smug gloating, and B is left to beg for A's forgiveness despite having done nothing wrong."</p>
<p>Seriously, in my opinion, this cliche is just awful. To explain why, let me frame it in the context of this chapter.</p>
<p>If the scene had played out like a number of you were probably expecting - that is, if Papyrus actually did think Mettaton was cheating, and Mettaton had to plead for forgiveness - it wouldn't have made either of the leads look good. Papyrus would have either looked really unintelligent (for not noticing that Mettaton clearly wasn't enjoying it) or really callous (for apparently not caring), and it would be especially bad because neither of those descriptions fits his character at all. (Papyrus may be naive, but he is not an idiot - and he especially isn't a jerk!) Meanwhile, Mettaton would look bad because he'd be forced to apologize for something that wasn't even his fault.</p>
<p>(And he might even be forced to take all the responsibility, while Papyrus takes no responsibility for jumping to the wrong conclusion; I have read a story like that, except it was for a completely different fandom. In that story, the falsely-accused guy asked the girl - who, when she thought he was cheating, absolutely ripped into him with her words, and even hit him, and never apologized for any of it even after the truth was revealed - if she forgave him, "even though [he didn't] deserve it". He didn't deserve to be forgiven for having a kiss forced on him...?!?!?! Even worse is that the girl just said "Yes, I forgive you" without saying anything about the second half of his statement. Creepy, huh? And yet we're supposed to want them to get back together.)</p>
<p>In any case, it would make their relationship look flimsy, if it can have a rift driven into it that easily; some readers might even ask "why do we want these guys to get back together again?" Besides, Papyrus most likely knows that Mettaton has lots of fans, and some of them might get a little... pushy. But he has no reason to doubt Mettaton, because Mettaton hasn't even given him a reason.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Bratty! Bratty! Do you, like, have the popcorn yet?"</p>
<p>Bratty turned her eyes away from the popcorn bowl she'd just finished pouring. "I just, like, poured it, Catty."</p>
<p>"Well, come on! It's gonna start in, like, a few minutes!" Catty headed to the fridge and got out the two-liters of soda before leaving the room.</p>
<p>"Like, wait up!"</p>
<p>The girls headed out to the front room of their apartment, where they'd set up their shared laptop on the coffee table. They all but threw themselves onto the couch as they waited with bated breath, staring at the screen. Mettaton was about to go live for at least the next couple of hours, and the girls wouldn't miss it for the world.</p>
<p>Finally, when the screen changed, the girls had their eyes glued to it like it was the most important thing in the world. Eventually, as the chatroom started going into overdrive, the title screen of one of Mettaton's licensed video games appeared, with a separate screen in one corner showing the man himself.</p>
<p>"Ohhh yesss! Welcome, beauties and gentlebeauties, to another edition of <em>Gaming with a Killer Robot!</em>"</p>
<p>The girls cheered loudly, and Catty's claws flew over to the keyboard; the message she sent consisted of the word "METTATON!!!!!!!!!" followed by several hearts.</p>
<p>"Tonight, we're going to be playing a game based on one of my many, many movies! And I also have a very special guest with me; he's a very good friend of mine." He looked offscreen. "Why don't you introduce yourself, darling?"</p>
<p>A tall skeleton who was dressed vaguely like a superhero came into view. "Nyeh heh heh! Attention, everyone! I, the Great Papyrus, am very pleased to meet you all!"</p>
<p>While a few members of the chat weren't quite sure of what to make of him, others gave him nice greetings. Bratty and Catty weren't entirely sure of what to think, either (aside from feeling a little envious).</p>
<p>"That's right, darlings! Tonight, Papyrus and I are going to play <em>Mettaton Catches Disco Fever!</em>" He looked at Papyrus. "I understand that, out of all the movies I've made, this is one of your favorites?"</p>
<p>"Indeed it is! The first time I saw it, I couldn't stop singing the songs for at least a couple of days! I hope my brother Sans didn't mind..."</p>
<p>Some of the chat members (especially the ones who had seen the movie in question) laughed; they, too, had had the songs stuck in their heads.</p>
<p>Mettaton laughed along with them. "Well, I hope all of you are prepared to have those songs stuck in your heads all over again! Let's not delay any further!"</p>
<p>As the two started the game, Bratty and Catty watched with rapt attention. They hadn't seen this movie quite as much as some of his other movies, but it would be interesting to get another perspective. Especially since this Papyrus guy seemed to be another of Mettaton's fans.</p>
<p>After the introductory cutscene, which displayed Mettaton (in all of his rectangular glory) expressing his desire to bring disco back into popularity, the game proper started. The background music for the first level was an instrumental version of one of the musical numbers in the movie (this would also be true for the other levels in the game, with each one having a different song); as such, Mettaton couldn't resist the urge to sing the lyrics when that part of the song came around. Early in the song, he grinned at Papyrus and said, "Sing it with me, darling!", and so it didn't take long for Papyrus to join in with the backing vocals. The chat members couldn't help but point out how much fun the two were having as they sang and played together.</p>
<p>In between these impromptu karaoke sessions, they would talk about various other things, such as the levels themselves, the movie the game was based on, and some of Papyrus' favorite Mettaton Moments. Sometimes, Mettaton would even ask Papyrus to tell the viewers about himself. The viewers, Bratty and Catty included, learned quite a bit about Papyrus during this stream; they learned that Papyrus liked cars, puzzles, making spaghetti, and saying "Nyeh heh heh!" and "Wowie!" - and, of course, that he was a huge fan of Mettaton.</p>
<p>During a lull in the action, Bratty whispered to Catty. "We should, like, watch this movie again."</p>
<p>Catty's eyes widened. "Oh my god. <em>Yes.</em> And then, we should watch the rest of his movies. We could, like, eat Glamburgers while watching them! Those are all three of my favorite things: Glamburgers, Mettaton, and being with you!"</p>
<p>"Like, oh my god, Catty! Those are <em>my</em> favorite things, too!"</p>
<p>And as the girls watched the livestream, they couldn't help but notice that, as of late, it appeared that one of Mettaton's favorite things was being with Papyrus. The way he seemed to let his guard down and laugh with him... was Papyrus becoming to him what the girls were to each other?</p>
<p>All the girls knew was that this livestream was wicked awesome.</p>

  <p>"C'mon, everyone! We're not gonna make it up the mountain just by standing around!"</p>
<p>Mettaton winced at Undyne's volume. "Undyne, must you shout like that on a mountain? Haven't you seen the movies? You could start an avalanche!" As much of a thrill-seeker as he was, he still had no desire for any of his friends to die or get seriously harmed, especially not today.</p>
<p>Alphys, who was standing with Undyne, looked back at Mettaton. "Actually, Mettaton, I did some research and I found out that shouting doesn't cause avalanches. Even when it's really loud, it's still too weak of a force."</p>
<p>"That's a relief!" Papyrus said. "I was briefly concerned that my voice would make rocks fall. Even though it would be cool to have a power like that, I don't want my friends getting hurt."</p>
<p>The four of them stood at a relatively low point on Mt. Ebbot, dressed in hiking boots and other appropriate gear. Every year, on the morning of this particular day, Undyne would climb Mt. Ebbot; it had only happened once before, but she was determined to make it a tradition. Last year, she'd only brought Alphys with her, but this year, they'd invited their respective best friends along. Maybe next year, Sans or Frisk or Asgore or Toriel (or any combination thereof) would be able to come along as well.</p>
<p>Undyne looked forward, up the trail. "Well, come on! Our voices may be too weak to cause avalanches, but that doesn't mean <em>we're</em> too weak to climb this mountain! Let's go!"</p>
<p>And so the four of them advanced up the trail. In the years following Frisk and the monsters' return to the surface, the trail had been made a little safer so that no one would end up falling into a much emptier Underground. While the Underground itself was still open to tourists, everyone just wanted to take precautions.</p>
<p>As they were walking up the trail, Undyne had an idea. "Hey, why don't we sing a song? It'll make it easier to pass the time!"</p>
<p>Mettaton grinned. "Ooh! I'm quite good at singing."</p>
<p>"Yes, he is!" Papyrus said with a nod.</p>
<p>Undyne briefly looked back at them. "Great! This is one of my favorites."</p>
<p>With that, she took a deep breath and began singing:</p>
<p>"<em>Miss Susie had a tugboat, the tugboat had a bell</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Miss Susie went to heaven, the tugboat went to</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hello operator, please give me number nine</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And if you disconnect me, I'll suplex your</em>
</p>
<p><em>Behind the 'fridgerator, there sat a piece of glass...</em>"</p>
<p>Mettaton and Papyrus looked at each other, wincing. From ahead, Alphys laughed nervously.</p>
<p>They continued up the mountain trail, with Undyne continuing to sing loudly while the other three just walked in an awkward silence.</p>
<p>"<em>...D-A-R-K! Dark, dark, dark!</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Dark is like a movie, a movie's like a show</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>A show is on a TV screen, and this is what I know</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I know that I know Alphys, and she knows Mettaton</em>
</p>
<p><em>I know I know Papyrus, he likes dancing on my lawn!</em>"</p>
<p>After holding that last note, Undyne turned back towards the others and laughed. "Isn't that song just classic?"</p>
<p>"Er... yes. Classic." Mettaton looked away and rolled his eyes. <em>You can't spell "classic" without... wait a minute.</em> He looked at Papyrus, feeling a bit confused. "Papyrus, darling, do you really like dancing on Undyne's lawn?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes!" Papyrus looked up. "I've heard some people refer to dancing as 'cutting a rug' and I thought, why would anyone want to cut rugs? They can be very expensive, and a lot of work goes into making them! But people cut their lawns all the time, so I thought it made sense."</p>
<p>"Yeah, and he usually mows it for us too, so I'm not complaining," Undyne said.</p>
<p>Mettaton shrugged. "Fair enough. Besides, there's nothing wrong with dancing." He struck a dramatic pose as well as he could in a backpack.</p>
<p>After walking for a little while longer, Undyne suddenly stopped and looked at the other trail that had appeared. The other three soon saw why she'd stopped; this trail led to the entrance to the Ruins. It was no longer just a hole; it had since been outfitted with an elevator.</p>
<p>"Just think about it," Undyne said. "If Frisk hadn't fallen down that hole, none of us would be up here today." She looked at the sky, remembering how Frisk managed to outsmart her. "That punk was determined... they still are!"</p>
<p>"Yeah... we really owe a lot to them." Alphys grabbed her water bottle and took a sip.</p>
<p>Undyne grinned at the others. "And you know what? I'm determined too. Determined to make it to the top of this mountain! Come on, everybody!"</p>
<p>The four made that last push, for it wasn't very long until they'd be able to reach the mountain's summit (or, at the very least, the top of the walkable trail). Deep down, Alphys felt a bit envious that her three companions got tired much less easily than she did, but she remembered how Undyne and Papyrus would tell her that the more she exercised, the easier it would get.</p>
<p>It would probably even help clear her mind for certain other projects.</p>
<p>At long last, the four made it to the peak. The world looked so small down below, and yet, they could see so far from where they were. Undyne took a deep breath and began to recite a speech she had prepared for this occasion (and she had taken copious amounts of notes so she wouldn't forget it, unlike the time she confronted Frisk near the entrance to Hotland).</p>
<p>"Two years ago, on this very day, monsters saw the sky for the first time in millennia. We all wondered if it would be possible in our lifetimes. When we woke up in the morning two years ago today, I don't think any of us were expecting for a human to be sighted in the Underground. And I just know none of us anticipated that, not only would we reach the surface by the end of that day, but we'd do it <em>without</em> killing the human or starting another war. But now, two years after that day, we're on the surface, that same human is one of our best friends, and the entire world is at our disposal. We are the monsters, and today, we celebrate our freedom!"</p>
<p>She summoned a magical spear, held it aloft, and let her battle cry ring out across the land.</p>
<p>Papyrus felt so inspired by his best friend's words that, after her voice died out on the wind, he struck his own pose and let out a "Nyeh heh heh heh heh!"</p>
<p>Mettaton looked at the two, shrugged, and also posed dramatically with an "Ohhh yesss!" to continue the theme of catchphrases.</p>
<p>With another nervous laugh, Alphys half-heartedly threw a fist in the air. "Um... yay!" This wasn't really the best time for her to not have a catchphrase.</p>
<p>They all stood there for a minute longer, staring out at the world in front of them, before Undyne spoke up. "So, should we head back down now?"</p>
<p>"We probably should." Mettaton checked the time on his phone. "I have to start getting ready for tonight's anniversary broadcast soon." This day was especially important to him; not only was it the anniversary of monsters reaching the surface, and of them meeting Frisk, but it was also the anniversary of Mettaton premiering his EX form to the world. Truly one of his finest moments to date, even if it had to be cut short thanks to his poor battery life at the time. (Fortunately, one of the first things Alphys did afterwards was improve his battery so that he could actually use this form on a more frequent basis. Given how proud he was of this body, it was the least she could do to make it up to him for what she'd done earlier.)</p>
<p>With a grin, Papyrus started back towards the trail, with the others soon following. "All right! I, the Great Papyrus, volunteer to be the next person to sing a song! And you all can sing along if you want to!"</p>
<p>Mettaton sighed. "Please tell me it's not going to be another vulgar one..."</p>
<p>"Why not? Vulgar songs are fun!" Undyne lightly elbowed Mettaton and gave him a smirk.</p>
<p>"Actually, I had this one in mind, and it's not vulgar." Papyrus cleared his throat. "<em>When I wake up, well, I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you...</em>"</p>
<p>Undyne grinned. "Hey, I know that one!" And then she joined in.</p>
<p>The four continued singing and talking as they went back down the mountain. Mettaton certainly hadn't anticipated going on a hike this morning (at least, not until a few days beforehand), but it would certainly provide lots of interesting stories in the future.</p>
<p>And besides, Papyrus was here, and Mettaton was really starting to enjoy his company as of late.</p>
